mr hoagie is an institution . walking in , it doe seem like a throwback to 30 year ago , old fashioned menu board , booth out of the 70 , and a large selection of food . their speciality is the italian hoagie , and it is voted the best in the area year after year . i usually order the burger , while the patty are obviously cooked from frozen , all of the other ingredient are very fresh . overall , it a good alternative to subway , which is down the road .
excellent food . superb customer service . i miss the mario machine they used to have , but it is still a great place steeped in tradition .
yes this place is a little out dated and not opened on the weekend . but other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order . which is always spot on fresh veggie on their hoggies and other food . they also have daily special and ice cream which is really good . i had a banana split they piled the topping on . they win pennysaver award ever year i see why .
pro : italian hoagie wa delicious . friendly counter employee . the restaurant wa clean and neat . con : the pizza wa not good . pre-formed crust , not fresh dough . the price of the failure of a pizza wa not cheap either . i guess the name say it all . get the hoagie , pas on the pizza .
first the only reason this place could possibly win best hoagie is because there is no competition . two hoagy and a side of onion ring cost $ 25.74so i am thinking with the reader choice award and $ 10 per 12 '' hoagie these will be awesome . i wa sadly mistaken . the only reason i did not give one star is because is the bread & dressing is fairly decent . so on to the hoagy , the italian is general run of the mill . minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce . you get more meat at subway . nothing really special & not worthy of the $ 10 price tag . second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious . no cheese ? ! ? ! ? you have to add cheese for $ 1 so now the steak hoagie is $ 11 . that ha so little amount of meat that i thought i wa eating a lettuce & onion hoagie . i am thoroughly disappointed with this hoagie , possibly the worst value of a hoagie i have ever eaten . i am not say eating at subway is any better , but for the huge price difference you are better off doing so . check out pasquales down the road , better hoagie & price .
normally , i do not do review of an establishment unless the rating is exceptionally great or exceptionally bad . if i had not felt sucker punched and mugged after i left mr. hoagie , i would not be writing this bad review . on my first and last trip there , i paid $ 24.59 for two whole hoagy . 1 ) the italian ( ordered because the woman ( she ) working there told me it wa their most popular hoagie ) i ordered with lettuce and onion ( no tomato , italian dressing which all come free with the hoagie ) . i had to pay $ 1 to add cheese to the hoagie . because i wa traveling and would not be eating the hoagie right away , i asked for the italian on the side . she told me there wa a charge for the dressing on the side . i passed on that on principle . are you kidding me ? i just saved her money by declining the tomato . i wa not going to pay for the dressing on the side . at this point , i am certain something is not right and this place appears to me to be in financial trouble . that pale in comparison to what happened next . i opened the hoagie and there were three microscopically thin slice of meat on this hoagie . ham , salami , and bologna . bologna ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? who in the hell put disgusting bologna on an italian hoagie ? that disqualifies that hoagie a an italian . the red flag indicating this place is in financial trouble are blinding my view . one area of this hoagie only had one slice of bologna , no ham and no salami.2 ) the steak hoagie came with nothing on it but lettuce , tomato , onion , and dressing . i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onion , or dressing . i asked for mayo on the side . i had to pay for that so i declined . are you kidding me ? i just saved them money by passing on the lettuce , tomato , fresh onion , and dressing ! i paid $ 3 to add sautéed mushroom , onion , and cheese . here we go again . canned mushroom that were not even cooked through ( were still cold ) and onion that were still crunchy/undercooked . news flash : you need to serve fresh mushroom that have been sautéed ( canned mushroom are another sign this place is in financial trouble ) . i literally had to open the hoagie to find the steak because i could not taste or see it . the hoagie wa 50 % mushroom , 30 % onion , 10 % cheese and 10 % steak.i could have personally made 10 whole hoagy with substantial quality ingredient and topping for the $ 24.59 i paid for these two whole hoagy . i intentionally patronize non-chain restaurant to support small business . in this case , never . again . ( the hoagie bun wa better than average . ) wake up or you are going to lose your business .
i like this place a lot . it is a good toasted hoagie.i actually do not like a my bun exploding with meat , but a a previous poster mentioned if you do maybe you would not like this place.the inside badly need updated though . the staff is friendly .
all the food is great here . but the best thing they have is their wing . their wing are simply fantastic ! ! the `` wet cajun '' are by the best & most popular . i also like the seasoned salt wing . wing night is monday & wednesday night , $ 0.75 whole wing ! the dining area is nice . very family friendly ! the bar is very nice is well . this place is truly a yinzer is dream ! ! `` pittsburgh dad '' would love this place n'at ! !
we checked this place out this past monday for their wing night . we have heard that their wing are great and decided it wa finally time to check it out . their wing are whole wing and crispy , which is a nice change of pace . i got their wet cajun sauce and garlic butter wing . the cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin . the sauce wa also thin for the garlic butter , but that is more expected . they were better than average , but i do not like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat . i would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other item on the menu , but this will probably not become a regular stop for wing anytime soon .
wing sauce is like water . pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce ( frank red hot maybe ) . the whole wing are good size and crispy , but for $ 1 a wing the sauce could be better . the hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat . the fish sandwich is good and is a large portion , side are decent .
cold cheap beer . good bar food . good service . looking for a great pittsburgh style fish sandwich , this is the place to go . the breading is light , fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fry . good grilled chicken salad or steak . soup of day is homemade and lot of special . great place for lunch or bar snack and beer .
possibly the most overhyped establishment in allegheny county . if you are not a regular , you will be ignored by those who are tending bar . beer selection is okay , the price are good and the service is terrible . i would go here , but only if it wa someone else is idea .
decent range somewhat close to the city . the mat are pretty solid ; however , the grass range need to be tended too . it is like hitting out of u open type rough ... not very amenable to practicing . which kind of defeat the purpose of going to a golf range ... still get 3 star because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of u who are addicted to this amazing game , but are somewhat short on time ( having a job kinda suck sometimes , no ? ) .
owning a driving range inside the city limit is like a license to print money . i do not think i ask much out of a driving range . decent mat , clean ball and accessible hour . hell you need even le people now with the advent of the machine that dole out the ball . this place ha none of them . it is april and there are no grass tee yet . btw they opened for the season this week although it ha been golfing weather for a month . the mat look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt irene is house . worn and thread bare . let is talk about the hour . this place is equipped with light yet they only sell bucket of ball until 730 . it is still light out . finally let you have the pit to hit into . when i arrived i wa not sure if this wa a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation . there is no grass on the range . just mud . make it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball . oh , they are cash only also.bottom line , this place suck . the best hope is that the owner sell it to someone that actually want to make money and service golfer in pittsburgh .
this place is absolute garbage ... half of the tee are not available , including all the grass tee . it is cash only , and they sell the last bucket at 8 , despite having light . and if you finish even a minute after 8 , do not plan on getting a drink . the vending machine are sold out ( of course ) and they sell drink inside , but close the drawer at 8 on the dot . there are weed grown all over the place . i noticed some sort of batting cage , but it look like those are out of order a well . someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
before i finally made it over to this range i heard the same thing from most people - it is just fine to go work on your swing . i had such a low expectation i wa pleasantly surprised . it is a fairly big range - if you are familiar with scally is in moon , it seems like it ha almost a many tee , though it not nearly a nice a facility . the guy in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guy i have come across at range or at course . yard were indeed marked and there are some target to aim for , and even some hazard to aim away from . a big red flag to me wa the extra charge ( $ 3 ) to hit off the grass . i am no range expert , but this is the 4th one i have been to and the first i have seen of that sort of nickel and diming ... .price for the golf ball wa reasonable and i do plan to be back every week until they close up in october for the season . hopefully , since it for sale , it will reopen a a golf facility again .
i drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak . it re-opens on july 14th and i can not wait to take my kid . the new range look amazing . the entire range appears to be turf , which may or many not help your game , but it look really nice . the tee box look state of the art and the club house look like something you will see on a newer course . can not wait to experience it !
this place wa delicious ! ! my parent saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebak is `` 25 thing i like about pittsburgh '' and he is usually pretty accurate . his recommendation were to try the reuben , fish sandwich and open-faced steak sandwich . we went early afternoon for a late lunch today ( a saturday ) and were seated right away . the staff is extremely friendly . my mom & i each had the fish sandwich , while my dad & brother had a reuben sandwich . the fish wa very good , but the reuben wa to die for ! both dish were massive , and could very easily be shared between two people . on top of being extremely large portion , it wa incredibly affordable . the giant fish sandwich wa $ 8 and the giant reuben wa $ 7.50 . our drink were always filled and we were checked on several time during the meal . we will definitely be back ! ! ! oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take cash only . so come prepared , but i am pretty sure i saw an atm there a well . and i do believe they are closed on sunday & monday .
can not miss stop for the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh .
this place should have a lot more review - but i am glad it doe not , they do not need to get any busier.its been there age , and look it . if you are all about ambiance , do not bother . if you pretend you are in a movie set in pittsburgh 30 year ago it work pretty well . the service is sometimes hit or miss . most of girl are good , one is very slow , one is amazing . they are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you are happy . everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing come flying out of that kitchen - busy time it can take a good while to get food . the food is awesome ! worth any little complaint i might think up before it get there . once it on the table , i forget them all.-fish sandwiich-salmon ( huge and delicious ) -flounder-shrimp a few way ( `` norfolk '' style is oily for my taste , and i never had it growing up in norfolk . ) -hawkins st special-prime rib ( sized for two , watch it ) the price are low , the portion are large , and just about everything on the menu is delicious . i am not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food , but if you like a good value and do not want to compromise on taste , this place is a gem .
this place wa very good . i found out about emil is when watching a show called `` 25 thing i love about pittsburgh '' on wqed hosted by rick seback . this place ai not a luxurious restaurant ... it is a beer & a shot bar / lounge . but the people are friendly & the food is good . i had the fish sandwich which wa great . it ai not in a great part of town , rankin , but i have been in worse place ! ! try this place .
old school ... ..traditional `` mom 'n pop '' quality and perfection . the best fish and chip you will ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp . a great out of the way , non-corporate , vestige of americana . you will love it .
seen this restaurant on 25 best place in pittsburgh with rick sebackack . went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner . she is very nice all employee are super nice service wa excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable price . going back to try the burger i heard there enormous and very tasty .
wonderful reuben . map shown on yelp page is incorrect . it is actually a different hawkins . i 'd recommend a call for direction 412-271-9911 .
good fish sandwich .
after a morning of thrift store hunting , a friend and i were thinking of lunch , and he suggested emil is after he 'd seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before , and i had not . he said they had a decent reuben , but to be prepared to step back in time.well , seeing a how i am kind of addicted to late 40 is and early 50 is , and the whole rat pack scene , stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh ... a long a it doe not involve 1979 , which i can see all around me every day.and yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burgh ... well , that is like hunting the holy grail . so looking under one more bush certainly would not hurt.so off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of ... where exactly were we ? at first i thought we were lost , driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking block in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway . and then ... aha ! here it is ! and yep , there it wa . this little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'emil is . we walked in the front door , and entered another world . another time , and another place . oh , and any big burrito/sousa foodie might a well stop reading now . i would not want to see you walk in , roll your eye and say 'reaaaaaalllly ? 'this is about a old world bar/lounge/restaurant a it get . plain , with a dark wood bar on one side , plain white wall with no yinzer pic , good sturdy chair and actual white linen on the table . this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few table together for some poker , a fish sammich , and some cheap scotch . and that is exactly what i love.oh ... but good food count too . we each had a reuben , and my friend had a side of fry . the reuben were decent , but not ny awesome . a little too thick on the bread , but overall , tasty and definitely filling . not too skimpy on the meat . i seriously crave a true , good ny reuben , but since i can not afford to travel right now , what i find in da burgh will have to do . but a we sat and ate , burger came out to an adjoining table . those were some big thick burger . a steak went past for the table behind u . that wa huge ! and when we asked about it , the waitress said 'yeah , it is huge and really good , and he only charge $ 12.99 for it , ai not that nut ? ' another table of five came in , and wham . fish sandwich piled with breaded fish that looked amazing . yeah , i want that , that , that and that ! my friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until 4 pm , and that it is fantastic . if only i could get there on that week day before 4 ... the waitress did a good job , especially since there wa quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday , and only one of her . she kept up and wa very friendly . they only have pepsi product , so i had a brewed iced tea , which wa very fresh , and she did pop by to ask about refill a often a she could . a the lunch hour went on , they were getting busy.emil is is no frill , good portion , very reasonable price , very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall ... kind of like cheer , but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950 is . fan-freakin-tastic ! i could feel at home here.you definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though . i am not sure that i could find it again on my own ... it really is a hidden gem . i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it is.addendum : 2nd visit for the fish sandwich . excellent . truly . a pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun ( a opposed to da burgh is seemingly popular hamburger bun ) . the fish wa flavorful , the batter excellent , and for just $ 8 . this may have been the best fish sandwich i have yet to have in da burgh .
this is a hidden gem , no really . it took u forever to find but well worth it . it is right across the street from the rankin police station . the menu ha a wide selection , i really could not decide what i wanted but i went with the ribeye sandwich . i am glad i did too . huge sandwich ! i added mushroom , it wa very flavorful . my boyfriend got the fish sandwich , he enjoyed it a well . fast and friendly service . will definitely be back .
from reading the other review , i see this place wa on some top 25 place in pittsburgh list a few year ago . i have not seen it myself , but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013 . it wa not until my almost 80yo buddy , mr. italo donatucci ( world is coolest old italian dude ) brought me one of the best fish sandwich i ever had that i became hooked ! i have had at least 10 since then , but only during the lent season . i gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone . try it without a bun also ! either way you get 3 nice size piece of fish equal to a pound . you can have your choice of side , but i always get the small mac n cheese for my side . the staff is always really friendly and service is prompt . it is in a rough neighborhood , but the rankin police station is right across the street . almost every visit there i have seen police officer inside mingling with the local or picking up lunch order . soon i plan to make a visit that is not a friday during lent to try other menu item .
another divey place we have been going to for year . my dad is favorite , a he know the original owner . certain item on the menu are named after the kid . huge portion , might have a bit of a wait some night . huge burger , fish sandwich , salad . decent service .
love my hometown favorite . can not beat their fish sandwich ( although i do miss the bun a opposed to the sliced bread ... stop that ) . always will support emil'sother favorite include reuben , hawkins avenue sandwich , chrissy club .
emil is is a great place to eat ! the price are very reasonable , the portion are huge and everything i have ever ordered ha been tasty and well prepared . the people who work there are so friendly , a are the customer who eat there . ample free parking make it easy to go there . i did not worry about the area- the police station is right across the street . do not leave the burgh without having ( 1 ) their fish sandwich , and ( 2 ) their reuben . you will be glad you ate there !
i love everything about this place . the food is delicious ( yes yes , the fish sandwich , ok , i agree -- but did you try the meatball ? ? holy tamoley ) , i adore the staff , and i love that there are no window -- it is it own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious , real food and good people . lot of place try to create this kind of ambiance , but it can not be manufactured . it take decade of good food and good vibes.also , the food is really good . : )
i had a hankering for some fried fish tonight and the fish fry at maximilian kolbe wa going to close before i got home on the bus , and i suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try emil is lounge a wqed is rick seback loved the place a did andrew zimmern when he visited for the bizarre food america episode featuring pittsburgh . the place is in rankin - a rough around the edge town in the mon valley between swissvale and braddock . do not be put off at first - the outside doe not have much decoration to speak of and look like the sort of place that you might think twice about it . a tgi friday it is not ... and thank god for that.the place is well-kept but a little dated - no frippery here . but we are not here for the decor - we are here for some dinner . the menu is basic with reasonable price . the meat and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order . their stuffed cabbage is regarded a the best in pittsburgh . i love stuffed cabbage but i just made a batch a couple of week ago and i am cabbaged out . their ruebens are also killer ( our waitress raved about them ) . my wife and i both settled on fish sandwich . these are true pittsburgh fish sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading , crammed between enormous pillow of soft , yet chewy and crispy mancini is italian bread . no adornment - just a boatload of hot crispy fish . emil is us thick cod fillet piled high rather than a thin fillet that need to be broken up to fit in the bun . truly a great sandwich . my daughter had the blt - looked good and on good bread and they were not skimpy with the bacon.the service wa very pleasant and friendly and the crowd wa a great group of folk . we all had fun with 4 other table when my wife pulled up a trivial pursuit game on her iphone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.overall , if you consider yourself a true pittsburgher - you must visit this place . it is one of the few place ( big jim is in the run is another ) where the spirit of pittsburgh is alive and hungry . please go .
we have been coming here for over 30 year , consistantly good food and friendly staff . vwey reasonably priced and large portion . the owner , chrissy ha taken what emil started year ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again . favorite are the fish and burger , hard to pick one !
we had gone to the frick mansion for a tour and i told my friend we were stopping off for a lunch in rankin . there wa not much enthusiasm about the location but the reluctantly agreed . we stopped in front and my wife said we are not going in there are we ? well once the order the food and enjoyed the best reuben , fish sandwich and stuffed pepper they were sold . the owner came over and thanked u for stopping . she is a real asset to the place . the restroom were spotless , which important to my wife . i have taken place where she had to hover over the commode . i went back two day later for the hulushki . a real gem a perfect place to eat real comfort food . do not forget the liver and onion .
excellent fish sandwich , wonderful reuben sandwich , even the stuffed cabbage taste homemade . chrissy is a delightful hostess and make you feel welcome . restaurant personnel are pleasant . i really enjoy visiting emils when i am in town my only regret is that they are closed monday . worth the trip
i wouldnt say the best fish sandwich ive ever had ... definitely a huge portion but rather bland and nothing special . very nice people and good service but i would largely disagree with most of the review here . atmosphere wa quite drab , classic western pa corner bar but no window , poorly lit , and overall fairly dismal ... . clientele seemed to be on death door , missing limb and morbidly obese . fry were frozen and under cooked . meatball were dry and bland a well . i had high hope but left feeling disappointed , defeated , bloated and like i had swallowed the entire rustbelt in one bite ...
this is my fourth time but my first review . it never disappoints ! always home cooking , old school like grandma is house . do not expect ambiance , but if you are hungry and want nice wait staff , ( usually family ) squeaky clean , great value and generous portions-way more than i can ever finish , emil is is your place.tonight i had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that wa sooooo good ! very obviously home made . i had a side of onion ring that were perfectly cooked , which doe not sound fancy , but i still could not finish . my husband had the chicken parm . thursday is italian night . it came with a huge salad , very fresh , an entire loaf of italian bread , and a generous portion of nicely crisped and tender chicken breast . added to that , a side helping of ziti . my husband enjoyed it very much , the chicken wa perfectly cooked . i am a sauce snob , italian , allergic to with an aversion to green pepper . to me , there wa just a hint of green pepper in the sauce so i probably would avoid anything with red sauce at emil is but that is just my quirk . i have had the stuffed cabbage there , the fried fish , ruebens , burger - all wonderful ! emil wa and his family is of serbian decent . food is love . we love emils !
i remember the old man 20 year ago eating a giant size hamburger used asked me question i miss those day food there is spectacular the fish is to die at four if you never been there just put it on your schedule of your thing to do and i promise you you will not be sorry .
great food & service every visit . they do so many thing right there especially taking care of the customer . i have always received a hello , a follow up on my food , a thank you and then a good bye . some many restaurant get away from these simple step of service . i am glad emil is ha not .
this is our second time here in two week . we have always liked emil is , but just have not been out this way lately . this is now going to change . last week we had the wonderful fish - it ha always been good . last week we stopped on a tuesday after golf . the bartender recommended the special of the day - the chicken romano with garlic and olive oil pasta . it wa truly outstanding ! i can not wait to go back and have it again ! the homemade tomato soup with asiago cheese wa delicious a well . thanks chef tony !
chicken romano ( yes , again - it is that good ) . my husband had the shrimp stuffed with crab - wow ! love , love ! thanks kk , great suggestion !
i like this course . it is always very well maintained . the cart are in excellent shape , all electric and all equipped with gps . the green fee are extremely reasonable and many of the hole are challenging , even if you are a better golfer . it truly ha a grand view up and down the mon , from the triangle and the cathedral of learning to braddock , the edgar thompson work , kennywood and beyond . yet , when you go a few more foot on the cart path , you are in the wood , alone with the abundant wildlife . one caveat- bring an abundant supply of ball . if you golf like i do , one sleeve will not be enough !
2nd time playing here . wa in the area for a bowling tournament so a group of u decided to come early and get a round of golf in . the course is hilly and challenging with readable and fairly flat green . but , a the name suggests , what a grand view of both the course a well a the surrounding area . cart are in excellent shape and provide you with electronic scoring and course gps . the folk here take pride in their course and take very good care of it .
challenging but fun course ! bring plenty of extra ball , i am a novice and lost at least 5 . cart are in great condition and remind you to stay on the cart path ( sometimes annoying when looking for ball but safety first ) and guide you to the next hole . the pro wa very nice and patient with our group a we had to delay teeing off for an hour due to parkway closure . driving range is nothing to write home about but get the job done for warming up . beautiful view and lot of variety of length and layout of hole . i will definitely be back !
this would be my local haunt , if i were ever to relocate to the pittsburgh area . what a great little place ! such friendly staff , and some damn good eats ! it wa so great , that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the steelers/ravens game . they have daily sandwich special . on thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand. , and the .35 cent wing . very , very tasty . i am sorry , but this place kick primanti bros. butt on the taste factor . they have about 8 different type of wing ... reg. , garlic , and i can not remember the rest - we got the regular , and i wa wishing we would had ordered more.going back on a friday night , we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n ' mushroom . wow ! that buffalo chicken pizza wa awesome.the other thing that stuck out for me wa one of the customer . an older gentleman ; he seemed to be a regular . i really , really wanted his spam t-shirt .
a great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele . i went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one friday night and it did not disappoint . it is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stop and everyone in the place is staring at you - i am guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fan , young men in collared shirt , and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place . the staff wa top notch - the order were somewhat overwhelming a they appeared short-staffed for the night , but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit . the other waiter wa wearing a hooded cardigan , and i wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.we ordered a white pizza - large in size , engulfed in cheese , full of garlic flavor , flavorful hot sausage . an overall delicious pizza , aside from 2 thing : 1 , way too much grease ( i know this come with the territory , but still , it is sometimes unbearable ) ; 2 , canned mushroom - the worst thing to come out of a can . ever . i would rather eat canned alpo than canned mushroom . and if the mushroom were not canned , they were just the worst mushroom i have ever consumed . the mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting ! my advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox , tasty food , great price , good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushroom ; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap , i will never know .
alexion is ha been around forever . the first time i went in there , i wa 19 year old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill . all of the union guy from the ice cream factory went in there after work , and i immediately found out why . many , many year later , i stopped in there with some fond memory , and once again felt welcomed and valued a a customer , even though they did not know who i wa . the sandwich are done pittsburgh-style , sort of like primanti is , and they are a perfect today a they were back in ancient time when i first started visiting the place . alexion is is a clean and peaceful little place in the rook station part of green tree , the oldest part of the town . i recall that some of the sandwich i got there were ordered at a pretty late hour . nothing but good thing to say about the place , and i wish it wa closer to home !
good for cheap drink and wing , they offer daily special which is nice . doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough , the bartender have been there for awhile and do a good job . dont expect to have a huge selection of alcohol . their wing are good a are their salad . if you are gluten free this is not your place ... lot of fried food and sandwich . offer a quick lunch .
what a cool bar/restaurant.. i will no doubt be visiting again . the service and price were great.. and the restroom were clean . i had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it wa delicious . the menu consists of typical bar food food , however ; there a few different item on there which stand out on the menu..a cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip . cheer ! !
awesome drink special during happy hour . fantastic wing that are crispy and delicious , wing night on tuesday and thursday !
good beer selection . understaffed for a light monday night crowd , it wa not her fault she wa the only server . but it took about an hour to get our sandwich . mine wa one of the best reuben i have ever had .
grew up near here . the family would always go once a month . have not stopped in for a few year until last friday with a few friend to grab a drink . the sandwich are always amazing just a i remember . the staff is amazing and friendly . great place for lunch a well .
very disappointed in the customer service . we ordered reuben is and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut . they charged u $ 3.00 for the coleslaw . we will not be back . the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
we met a couple of friend there on a friday afternoon about 440 pm , based on the yelp review . i have relied on yelp in over a dozen different city , never came away with anything le than a positive experience until today . we ordered within 5 minute of sitting down , there could not have been more than 20 people in the place , counting the people on the patio . took them almost 40 minute to serve 3 sandwich and a salad . i tried the fish sandwich , came out fried extra crispy on the end , if there is such a thing a fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified , it wa just ok . i have had better at almost any church that fry fish during lent . all 3 of my dinner companion left partial sandwich or salad uneaten . bread french fry and onion ring were good though . iced tea wa good , though i have never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack . asked for sugar but never saw any , they do not carry any other artificial sweetener besides the pink stuff.i may give the place another try in the future for a reuben or hamburger , assuming today wa some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that . waitress wa pretty good , held up under my multiple request to find out if they caught my fish yet , hardly ever rolled her eye : )
the bar is nice enough the server are attentive enough the food is good enough . their is absolutely nothing wrong with this place but the problem is it is not a place that will stick out from the crowd . it is kind of lost in the crowd . pittsburgh is a city full of bar this one is relaxed . it is a great neighborhood bar . and i would come back but it is not a wow that is a great place . it is just good enough
friendly local bar with great service and good food , will not be disappointed if you like bar food at a reasonable price . good place to go for `` friday fish sandwich ``
friendly staff , good food , great beer selection , and relaxing atmosphere . great wing and the buffalo chicken pizza is the best i have had . the sandwich are all on thick cut italian bread and fresh . definitely a hidden gem of the greetree/carnegie area . looking for a low key hole in the wall with good price and great food this is your place .
found this place on yelp and glad we did . great beer selection , the sandwich are wonderful and huge , wing were very good . family owned establishment and everyone we met wa great , the owner , waitstaff and kitchen staff . if we ever get to the pittsburgh area again , we will go back !
perfect joint ! do not be afraid a you pull up ... it is a nice little neighborhood . wa in town on biz and my hotel wa right up the street . great service , well apportioned serving and unique menu make this place worthy of a check in !
i went to alexions with a co-worker/friend for lunch during lent . first impression , it wa small and packed . this is apparently a very popular lunch stop . they have a nice outdoor seating section , but it wa closed due to the weather . i opted for their friday special a fish sandwich with cheese , hold the cheese . i hate cheese on fish , in my mind it doe not go well together . it came with one side and chip . i opted for cole slaw because that doe go great with fish . the chip were straight out of a bag . i am not a chip fan , especially not one that lay is delivered . it would have been nice to have homemade chip . the special wa 10.50 , so i wa hoping it would be good.the wait wa not terrible for a busy a they were , but if you are on a strict time schedule for lunch i 'd call ahead . the food arrived in about 20 minute . my fish sandwich though nice size wa a little small for the price , compared to other is that are cheaper . the slaw wa nice , good flavor but the fish wa average . i loaded it up with some tarter and cocktail sauce to help the flavor out . it wa not a bad sandwich just a tad small and mediocre for the price . i would stop back to try something else another time and would love to grab a beer here , a they had a really decent selection , and the server were also pleasant .
this place ha a real neighborhood vibe to it , and offer a nice selection of brew along with a decent menu if you are here for a meal . comfortable decor , decent service and reasonable price make this a good spot for a sojourn if in the area . the bartender wa cool in offering sample of draft before i selected , and the food ( i had wing and zucchini plank - both excellent ) wa very good .
fantastic ! great food , excellent beer selection ! bartender are great ! it is a great hometown neighborhood bar with good people and friendly staff . the food is a good selection of var type food with large sandwich . excellent wing !
i go here to get away and enjoy a nice drink and great company . the service is always top notch and customer service is awesome . first class management and food .
used to go there for tire , brake , etc . their price have gone way up- $ 400 for 4 mid-level tire for a toyota . plus , 1 of the new tire went flat within 3 week . since they don '' t make appointment , the wait to get the tire looked at wa ~2 hour . sorry -- can not wait that long to get a warranted repair , they lost my business for good .
i got 'new ' tire from them and within two week got a flat . i took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched , but they said the reason i had a flat wa because the previous patch had blown - wait , what ? i just got the tire and never needed to have it patched ? this wa supposed to be a new tire . i took the tire over to flynn is and they told me that someone punctured my tire , then tried to patch it . so there are resentful tire slasher ? i find that very unlikely . after arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic wa far fetched he said he 'd give me a new tire `` this time '' . i will never go back to flynn is b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire !
terrible . preordered my tire and when i arrived they could not find the order anywhere . once we got through that process i waited over 2 hour for them to be put on ... i wa originally told it would take 30 min . slow , over priced , i will go elsewhere next time .
contrary to other review , i have zero complaint about the service or the price . i have been getting tire service here for the past 5 year now , and compared to my experience with place like pep boy , these guy are experienced and know what they are doing . also , this is one place that i do not feel like i am being taken advantage of , just because of my gender . other auto mechanic have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of car , and have sucked my bank account dry . but here , my service and road coverage ha all been well explained - and let up to me to decide . and they just renovated the waiting room . it look a lot better than it did in previous year .
last summer i had an appointment to get new tire and had to wait a super long time . i also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on . they `` fixed '' it for free , and the very next morning i had the same issue . i called to complain , and the `` manager '' did not even apologize ! ! ! so frustrated . never going back . they seem overpriced , too .
i got a tire replaced here in nov . the same tire had a bubble in a few week . after some initial challenge , spoke to the manager keith and the issue wa take care off .
awesome experience ! i came in all fatalistic with my flat tire on a workday morning with a full schedule . they saw me and worked on my car like a nascar pit crew.i wa prepared to buy new tire . they offered to look to see if they could repair.they repaired them . i saved alot of money . # integrity # greatcustomerservice
i took my wife is car in for new tire on good friday . i felt that the price were reasonable , i did not feel pressured to buy the most expensive tire , and i wa out in le than 2 hour with no appointment .
most random location for a mini golf course ever . this is old school . it is built into the wood ( spray yourself for bug first ) right off forsythe rd near carnegie park . the candy hut is fun to spend your spare change . they recently re-carpeted the hole and added a few gimmick that were not there before . it will not knock your sock off , but if you are local , give it a try !
this quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest , yet most original and fun location that i have yet visited . coming from texas , it wa nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody pennsylvanian terrain . it can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also make it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce . the cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laugh and a fun attempt to play . improvement were being made and i will look forward to returning on my next visit to the pittsburgh area . i enjoy traveling and visiting new course and the only reason why i did not give this location 5 star is because it wa impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par .
i think this place is closed . their number is out of service , sign is gone and the course ha not been maintained . awesome woodsy mess of a course though !
i have been informed by a fellow yelper that they are just closed for the season , i hope they are right ! i find it strange they do not keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they did not cover the course up to protect it from weather , vandalism , etc . either way , i can not wait to get my game on in the spring !
do not waste your time . we had two different people come to our house to give u estimate for a deck ( one of them the owner ) . both time , we never heard from them . not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
i will start by saying we have a nice new deck . that is where the good part ends.why two star if we have a nice deck now ? well , it all started in may when we had a man named al come out and talk to u about the process . he wa a true salesman , i will tell you that . not a straight shooter , but an excited salesman that wanted to sell ... and we bought into it.he told u they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of job , but they could probably start by june 24th . mind you , this wa the end of may we met with him . he said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from dormont before they started . we felt confident in going with them , and booked it.here is where thing fell apart . week went by with no word from them on the process . finally i called and left message . al finally got in touch with me and the conversation wa utterly confusing . he must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circle . so i hung up not knowing what wa going on . finally i called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple week to come back . i wish al would have told u that.so our june 24th date came and went . we finally got our survey . and they were quick to bill u for it , but no word on where we were in the process . i called back a couple time with no real answer from the admin . apparently they were now waiting for the permit from dormont.a month later , i wa frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company . i spoke with someone who told me that dormont usually take a week to process the permit , but we were now going on a month . he told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it . i completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault , but why no communication about it ? just call me and tell me they are waiting for the permit , but they will work towards asking dormont what the hold up is . seems simple.finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start . tuesday come and they have to wait for approval from dormont on hole they are digging . so hole are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two day . where did everyone go ? who know , because i wa not informed ! i wa upset and contacted the company owner , dave , by email . i told him how frustrated i wa about the lack of communication . he wrote me two sentence that said `` there will be acre there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow . '' well , that did not happen.then two other dude show up two day later and did work for about three hour and left . the main guy come back the next day and say they did it wrong . so apparently the part about how they would not need access to my house change to they are drilling bolt into my house to secure he deck . finally , the second week into construction , my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done . it wa upsetting that they left the deck dirty , and all the dirt and cement they moved around wa not cleaned up . i even asked them to fill all the hole they dug up and did not use , and they only filled up one . when you create a construction project , is not it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice ? did not happen here.my main point is , contractor have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy . why be that company ? why not be an upstanding company that consumer can trust ? my main issue with them were that thing were not communicated to me properly up front , nor wa the ongoing process communicated to me . then they left everything unfinished in my eye , leaving the site dirty . i understand thing happen and thing get delayed , but just email or call me . it is not that hard to keep me updated , it is 2014 with a million way to be contacted.even though i have a nice deck ( after i clean thing up myself ! ) , i would not recommend them to anyone .
when i wanted a deck for the back of my home i ended up calling quaker state construction . it ended up working very well and they were very polite . i got an estimate and called them to start working out the detail of my new deck . once we got the plan all sorted out they started building my new deck and it wa finished with in a reasonable amount of time . i now have a beautiful deck that i can relax and that my family can enjoy . overall , they did a good job and i would use them in the future for all my deck necessity .
our cat went out the other night and must have gotn into a fight . he wa wounded but we could not tell the extent of his injury . my girlfriend called them today and they made an appt for u immediately . when we got there , i could not believe how friendly and caring they all were . we went into the exam room with doctor tierney kelley and a vet asst sam . they were the best . so gentle and caring . they did not pressure u into any procedure that my cat did not need . they worked hard so we did not have to leave him over night . this wa by far the best veterinarian i have gone to in all my year a a pet owner . this ha all become a racket for making money . doctor do not care about the animal in 90 % of the place you go , but greetree animal clinic is not one of those place . i will be taking my other pet there from now on and recommend this place and doctor kelly to everyone i know . thank you so much again if you read this . doctor kelley you are the best .
greentree animal clinic is the absolute best ! we have had both dr mann and dr. reuther . both are very good , each in their own strength . i recently had to have my beloved dog euthanized due to a tumor growing on his hip . dr. mann wa very sensitive and caring to my feeling of loss . he offered to make a clay paw print from my dog after he passed . he went above and beyond to make sure he had a peaceful passing with me by his side . thank you for allowing me that experience , and for guiding me through the process .
i can not praise this place enough . i have worked a a vet tech in a previous job and have had experience at numerous facility here in pittsburgh and greentree animal clinic blow them all out of the water . key thing that you should note about this place : * they do not over charge* they only recommend services/things that they genuinely believe will help your pet , not their bottom line and they do not pressure you in any way* they are respectful and genuine to you and your pet which is hard to come by nowadays* everyone from the front desk to the tech , to the vet are kind , patient and understanding . no condescension or poor attitude , just positive vibe all around . * dr brown go above and beyond any vet i have ever met . he ha shown so much care , professionalism , kindness and knowledge that i will gladly refer anyone with a pet to him because i know they will be in good hand and his fellow vet ( dr reuther , dr kelley , and dr mann ) are just a phenomenal . thankyou greentree animal clinic for setting the bar where it should be for all veterinary care facility .
i can ; t believe this place ha a high rating . i had a bichon , who wa seen here since his puppyhood and who wa dying . i called to make an appointment to have him put down because he wa in great pain . the receptionist would not give me an appointment until one week later , even though she could hear him cry out in pain . anyway , he died in agony before his appointment . this wa in 2010 and i have not taken my subsequent pet to the clinic .
three month ago i brought my 13 yr old golden retriever to this clinic for an ear problem . it wa diagnosed and treated . shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like . i watched her for a couple hour do this and then called the vet to see if maybe she wa having an allergic reaction to the medicine they gave her . she wa very uncomfortable . i asked if they though she needed to come back to the office . the dr told me that it sounded like she wa overheated and to put cold towel on her . i told him that i did not think that wa the problem because she had not been out . at this point they were open and would be for another hour . two hour later i wa at a vet hospital with them telling me she is suffering from a heart problem and that they really could not do anything for her . what ? ! ? ! so i found myself having to put her down . fast forward to now . i have a 14 wk puppy that ha blood in it stool . they have not seen her yet . i bring in a sample . wait 24 hr . they leave a message that it is positive and to call for an appt . i call . she ha to wait 4 day to be seen . what ? ! ? ! ? obviously my pup are out of there for good ! thanks greentree for caring for my animal ... absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vet ! !
nice , suppose to be haunted . in carnegie off main st. closed sunday during summer . during school season open some night until 7pm .
awesome historic building high on top of the hill in carnegie . home to stage 62 , a theatre group that put on musical . i recently saw sideshow and evita here . great sound and comfortable chair , an all around pleasant experience for a pleasant evening or sunday matinee . plenty of free parking and at only 18 dollar it a true bargain . and yes , the rumor are true , this building is haunted .
beautiful restoration of the library and music hall . look forward to coming here for show .
i am not by any mean a gear head , i am lucky i know where to put the gas in my car . i have triple a in case i get a flat , because i have no idea where my jack is . i took my present car back to the dealership the day after driving it off the lot to have them show me how to turn on my hazard signal , also , to show me how to release the parking brake , and how to turn on the rear defoggers . yes , the owner manual wa in the glove box , but there wa way too much reading involved , and i learn quicker by hand on training.advanced auto is a god send for me , when i needed windshield wiper , the one on the car sounded like a cow being skinned alive each time i turned them on . so , i did not use them often , which is not good in a driving rain storm . i walked in and went up to an associate and asked him where the wiper were . not only did he get me the wiper , he saved me a ton of embarrassment by putting them on for me at no extra charge . i gave him a nice tip which he refused , but i insisted . i also picked up a nice leather steering wheel cover ( proud to say i figured out how to put that on without a mechanic ! ) and a gas additive to clean out my fuel system . this place ha everything , and if you are not a gear head , they will either show you how or do it for you . great customer service !
great people ... great service ... great product ... always busy
i actually stopped at the one at the crafton ingram shopping center but they are all basically the same . i had been here earlier this year to get replacement wiper blade . the man who helped me not only gave me his recommendation on what would be good for winter driving but also put them on my car.today is visit wa to purchase some general car supply a a holiday gift . they carry basically everything you need for self service . i am not overly sure on their pricing but since it is convenient for me i visit it.so far i have been pleased with my purchase .
i have never seen a restaurant that ha a frowning brownie ( a.k.a . frownie ) a their icon , mascot , or spokesperson . king is family restaurant ha surprised me with this . i think it might be in direct dialogue with eat n ' park smiling cookie -- funny ( funny odd , not funny ha-ha ) . we were seated rather quickly by the manager . very nice people work here , i wa happy to find that even though they had closed a section , the server wa willing to stay longer to serve u our dinner.we chatted with the server a little bit -- she wa quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal : teapepsiopen-faced hot turkey sandwich with mashed potato and gravybuffalo chicken strip with mashed potato and macaroni n ' cheeseour drink arrived and our server conversed with u some more about the area . she would leave every couple of minute to check on our food and to make certain that her other table had everything they needed . eventually , our entree arrived -- both piping hot . i went straight for the macaroni and cheese . it did not taste bad , but i swear that it is made by stouffers . i did not feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other thing to eat . i tried the mashed potato and found that they too came from a package ; but , again , they did not taste bad with the brown gravy . i moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strip . at least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce wa more than just mild . i contented myself with eating them . i tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it wa not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated . i finished off my dinner and wa happy in the end . no , it wa not the best food in the world , but the service greatly helped the perception and it did not taste bad .
so ... back in the late 90 , there used to be this super-kick-ass cinnamon ice cream , like an apple pie ice cream without the apple or the pie crust . so delicious ! however , now there is some shit-tastic replacement that taste like vanilla ice cream with last year is red-hot in the middle : totally gross . fortunately , our server wa nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample , so i only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.the portion are big and filling , just do not come for the ice cream .
ive pretty much been eating at various king ' pretty regularly since i wa a child when my parent would take my sister and i into the fox chapel location often . lately me and my girl have been visiting the heidelburg location . i love the food , it really taste homemade , much like something a grandmother would make , complete with gob of butter and side dish . price are low , selection is great , but dont expect fine dining by any mean . service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them ; if you have lunch at any king , you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic older lady who ha been doing the waiting thing for 30 year and know her game . seek out this lady . my experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.im in my 30 now , and very little ha changed , other than the fox chapel location wa remodeled about 10 year ago to look le like a diner , which wa a big fail . any girl i meet ha to enjoy king or she is out .
hoofah .
i heart king is . i have always been a fan and this one wa a good a my old one in monaca .
i arrived around 10 am on a saturday morning . i wa greeted by the hostess , who wa polite and friendly , and i informed her that i wa alone . she had just arrived , a well , and wa not exactly sure what wa going on yet , so she asked ( the manager ? ) where she should seat me . after receiving guidance , she brought me to a table towards the back . it had not yet been cleaned after the previous guest had dined . so , she quickly got it cleared off , grabbed a rag , and wiped it down.the waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order . she wa extremely friendly . i ordered coffee and water , which she went and got while i looked over the menu . she returned , and took my order . i ordered the cinnamon swirl french toast special - three slice of french toast made with pittsburgh is own jenny lee® cinnamon swirl , two farm-fresh egg , with bacon or sausage ( i chose sausage ) , and your choice of potato ( i went with the cheesy hash brown casserole ) . i also added an orange juice . she went and put my order in , while i waited , and came back with it after not too long . the egg were cooked exactly how i wanted them , the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious . i also enjoyed the sausage which wa pretty typical.kings family restaurant featured a very friendly staff , great price , and tasty food . i am pleased and will definitely come back again .
breakfast time ! i stopped by the king family restaurant prior to grocery shopping . i have never been to a king family restaurant since moving to pittsburgh . there are several local establishments.this particular location ha pretty good food at a great price . it is similar to a cracker barrel and / or bob evans . i ordered something very hearty - country fried steak , egg , and cheesy potatoes.the food and coffee were good . the service wa excellent . i will go back . breakfast run from $ 5-8 . my breakfast cost me just over $ 10 - very comparable to cracker barrel / bob evans .
good service but the last 2 time we have gone there have been hair in my son is kid meal.. a bit disappointing .
average run of the mill store . associate are young teen and they really do not know where anything is . luckily i am able to get around to find everything . found my puppy treat and moved on .
not bad for a shop n save , most are privately owned , so availability of item might differ from place to place . the only time i frequent s n s is when the have their huge two day sale usually held on thursday and friday at least once month.good bakery at this location too .
this sn and the one in bethel park are my two favorite . staff always friendly and the deli staff in both location are great ! in my experience , if teen staff do not know where something is , they ask another staff member . shopping these two store is a pleasant a it get .
one of the biggest , cleanest , busiest shop n save i have ever been to . nice friendly staff . great layout . and again , so clean ! ! !
this place went from great to horrible . first visit wa for a flat tire and recommended . absolutely no problem . now when i needed my car inspected in june , they put snow tire on my car . noisy snow tire in the summer ! i told them i did not want these tire and they told me i would have to come back the next day and talk to the owner . when i went back the owner told me they were not snow tire . the tire were called blizzard ! i told him they are too noisy . he told me to come back another day . i tried and tried but he never had the time . very rude and once they get paid have no ethic .
my wife recently went to buy 4 `` used '' tire to replace her balding tire . while there she also got an inspection . the person working only sold her 2 tire that were needed and said her other two were fine . she also had no way home so had to sit and wait for everything to be done . since she wa waiting they did the inspection right away . they had a chance to oversell her product and did not . i can not think of a better way to promote a mechanic business than by not ripping off your customer because they do not know better . thank you for your great service and your honesty . the `` used '' tire are great . we just had a snow today and they did perfectly . the price could not be beat either . $ 180 total for 2 tire installed , inspection and emission .
unfortunately , i only have one complaint about this dry cleaner . it wa well kept and clean inside . the man waiting on me ( i am guessing the owner ) wa very nice , both dropping off and picking up , even though i lost my ticket . turn around time wa ok for a cleaner that do not do cleaning on premise . what is my problem then ? price . my daughter is dress wa $ 18 to clean . i think that is close to what i paid for it . my lady shirt were $ 6/unit . maybe i am not calibrated on pgh price but this seems outrageous . my search continues for a neighborhood cleaner . btw , they do men is tailoring there on-site and it look like it might be a big part of their business . i would try them again for that ( after i check cost ! )
never go to rossi tailoring and dry cleaner 393 vanadium road pittsburgh , pa 15243 . i decided to use a local business to do my dry cleaning . i dropped off 3 shirt at this establishment just before thanksgiving . it is now late january . i have stopped by more than a half dozen time and have been given only one of the shirt . they have offered $ 20 a shirt for the shirt they lost . those shirt are worth at least $ 50 each , and i refuse to take under $ 30 for each . i am tired of the run around , tired of promised phone call that never happen ( they have never called me ) . i would not use their service again if you paid me to .
i went to rossi is for my first time , two week ago . i had two suit and one jacket tailored . everything wa ready in le than two week . these suit were brand new and on the expensive side . i did not know who to trust them with . i went to rossi is because a friend highly recommended them . my friend had a tuxedo custom made by rossi is . i am extremely happy with the end result ! i wanted a european cut on jacket and no break on the slack ; a nice tailored look . the suit look awesome . i am going to go through my closet and take some of my older suit to be tailored ( some of my older suit are a little looser fitting ; i now like the more tailored european look ) . juliano ( the owner ) will shorten the length of my jacket , take the side in and shorten my slack . they will look brand new.as for the price , i am very happy . i would not go to the cheapest barber in town ( for obvious reason ) . i feel the same about a good tailor . a for the service , they could not be nicer . thanks for a job well done !
i want to write the greatest review yelp ha ever seen . i want yelpers from all across this great land to read this review and think to themselves `` i wish i could write a review like this one . '' this review must be honest , to the point , be the subject of debate and casual comversation . it should be humorous too , not so humorous that it loses it is methodology . it should make you want to go to this establishment and see it for yourself . when you get here , you fall to you knee and scream `` it truely is indeed a mecca '' this review must compel yelpers from all over the world to come to pittsburgh to see this attraction that i have written about . i want people from india , canada , mexico , italy , germany , france , and even the little country like wyoming and pluto to gather here and praise me to the highest , seat me at right hand of you know who , and sing me the ava maria and bett midler is version of the boogie woogie bugal boy.once i leave this big blue marble , i want people to remember me a the man who wrote the greatest yelp review ever . people will bring child to my grave and say to them `` you should read his review , for it wa the most honest , thoughtful , and heartfelt review ever written . flawless , it flow like a gentle brook on a spring day . '' my review will be the subject of future thesis , lecture , and studied by philosophers.and now , without further adeu , my greatest review ... this is a gas station .
real talk : i took my car through the carwash here once , got a nasty gouge down the side , and the guy at the counter did not seem to care . the car wash ha since been decommissioned , which is totally ok because the getgo carwash across the street is excellent and better in every way .
typical bp . usually pretty crowded in the evening due to location on washington but never had to wait to long . staff is pretty nice and always pleasant . can not comment on the coffee or anything else because i only ever get gas .
station is closed . sign is blank and all fixture from the store have been removed .
two meal , on the recommendation of a friend who life near the place , and after the second trip , i wa compelled to write . 'rocky ' would definitely describe the experiences.on the first trip , i went to try their ( at that time ) raved about reuben . and yet to find a true good reuben in da burgh , i tried it.well , they were out of the proper bread , and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find , which wa not the proper bread , and instead of one of their 'raved about ' reuben , i received two mini-reubens , which basically took the gut from one reuben , and spread it out onto two sandwich on regular sized bread . i ate it . it wa not great , but they swore it wa because they 'd run out of the bread . bread or not , it still wa not great . the atmosphere wa pleasant in that 'blue collar bar ' kind of way , and the staff wa very nice , but not a winning pitch on the reuben.the second trip wa after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend . sat in the back room , instead of the bar , which felt more like a restaurant , of course , with the big screen tv covering the sport of the moment.i wa in the mood for dinner this time , and after a scan , decided on fried chicken and mashed potato with the salad bar . my friend ordered one of her faves , the breaded pork chops.we hit the salad bar , which wa uber-basic . three soup ( mostly vegetable loaded , which left me out ) , basic iceberg lettuce mix ( very probably out of a bag ) , a few veggie topping , and three or four dressing . it wa a basic salad , no big deal . more or le an appetizer filler before the meal.the mind-blower in this trip wa the ordering of the fried chicken dinner . our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant , skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face , and an air of vapidity , which wa confirmed when i placed my order . i asked what chicken piece came in the dinner , and asked if it wa possible to only get dark meat . i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be . it literally took him two trip back to the kitchen to 'ask ' , and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat ' and 'dark meat ' meant . the first answer he came back with wa that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag , kind of kentucky fried chicken style ... which did not answer my question , thus prompting the second trip . after the second trip back i heard the cook holler 'tell him i will fix him up ' . well , the chicken wa prepackaged dreck like you 'd find in the freezer case of walmart , tiny and not good , and the potato had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor , laden with some kind of chopped up green ( parsley ? ) , and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.thank goodness for the basic salad bar.even my friend admitted that her pork chop were different and not what she 'd expected . they also appeared to be from a freezer bag.the irony wa that the boy who did not know white meat from dark meat , wa chatting with some other customer ... about baseball ... and he wa a genius about the mindless sport of baseball . ahhhh da burgh.third base ? nah ... why bother when there are so many other option around . go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in carnegie ... they can help you out all type of way in that area . just do not go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.from what i understand it 'used to be ' really good homecooked food . but apparently , mama ha left the kitchen .
this place is dirty and smell food is reely bad i took it home and feed it to the dog . hope he do not get sick from the food like i did .
if you are searching for a go to fish place for lent ... .look no further . this place will give you the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh . the sandwich ha enough fish to make four sandwich . you will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.enjoy ... .
this is a great little gem ! on my last visit to pittsburgh i wa looking for a nice bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a penguin playoff game . a friend of mine who lived in the area recommended rocky is . a i walked in the door i wa pleasantly approached by the server and shown a table . it wa clean , welcoming and the lounge wa busy . it wa friday night and the special wa the fish fry . i ordered the fish and in the meantime i sipped on a draft brew . the order wa delivered to my table in no time . the fish and side were tasty and the portion size wa large . a i wa watching the game and enjoying the heck out of my dinner i noticed a dessert case with a nice selection of cake . well needle to say i got a togo box for what wa left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake . another good choice ! at the end of night the penguin could not pull off the win over the ranger but i definitely have a new `` go to '' when i am in town . another star could be added for a smoke free environment . i do not smoke but i understand they have a nice outdoor area for those who do .
rocky is ha been in business since the 1980s and still going strong . their food is good . not haute cuisine , pretentious ! everyday , well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking . i have mostly gone during supper hour and and ate in the dining room , but , today i introduced an old friend to `` linner '' in the bar.he ordered the large version of fish sandwich . rocky is is famous for their fish . three large breaded and fried fish filet , bun and fry for under $ 10 . needle to say , he had no complaint and brought home more than he ate.i ordered the meatball grill . it wa delish . served on thick cut italian bread and made `` grilled cheese '' ( mozzarella ) style . meatball and tomato sauce are both good ! also , served with fry . i brought home half the sandwich.another good meal there . friend , mother , and former bos all enjoy their food !
italian dinner , american , endless soup and salad bar is great . most food for your dollar . i highly recommend . great bar . good place to watch a game . the bar can get quite noisy in the evening , but it add to the great atmosphere at rocky is
i have been to this place a million time over the year . have been there during the year it wa le than clean , to the present where it is almost clean . this place is a neighborhood standard that for some reason compels you to return , even if your experience wa le than stellar . fancy it is not . gourmet it is definitely not . every item on the menu seems to come from a can , bag , bucket or box . the wait staff is often clueless and change like the wind . i have never had the same server twice . but the fact is you get a decent meal for a decent price and always have a little to take home . yes , the salad bar is very basic . not every item is a fresh a it should be . the iced tea often take on the taste of lord know what . however , the fried fish dinner is one of the best i have had anywhere in picksburg . their meatloaf is terrific a are several of their hoagy . in a nutshell , this place ha a lot of flaw . like we all do . a few upgrade like a better wait staff , fresh gravy instead of their gallon bucket brand , homemade sauce instead of whatever canned stuff they are using would jump this review to 5 star . rocky is is worth going to . you will definitely find something you like and you will definitely go back . decent food , decent price , good portion and an overall pleasant experience .
great local bar . theresa doe a great job . sandwich are excellent . recommend meatball , reuben , burger , fish sandwich .
to be clear this is not a fancy place by any mean . the decor is a little dated and leaf a lot to be desired . the food is basic and simple , but it is delicious . sometimes simple is better ; this is definitely one of those time .
generous portion of really great food . best fish sandwich . not fancy ... real food for real folk !
if you want a true understanding of pittsburgh in the morning , come here . this greasy spoon is always packed , and is one of the better of it kind south of the city.they serve waffle in half , which is great . the egg and toast are good , the homemade hot sausage is excellent . the drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.if you are hungry , get `` the mixed grill '' ... gab and eat is brand of the `` kitchen sink '' breakfast that all midwest place are about .
good luck getting a seat , that is all i have to say . the gab and eat is famous and infamous . diner food is what is up and i like it . when i wa a roofing mechanic , we 'd meet there before work . although i am not sure i would recommend it if you are working were there is no bathroom . hehe
stick to basic and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh . first time go with a friend and sit at the counter . short order cooking at it is best , it is like a floor show with the actor is back to you . breakfast ha no loser . egg , omelet , pancake , waffle , breakfast sandwich to order , the ever popular mixed grill , get a 1/2 louie instead of home fry ( although they good a is ) and do not forget the italian toast.frequently voted the best burger in pittsburgh for a reason . a for ambiance , well let just say i do not think there are two matching plate or coffee mug in the joint . but the coffee is good and hot and refreshed often a the service is good , andlocal with many long time folk working here . if i do not get there for awhile i need to go through detox because i feel too healthy .
the biggest breakfast in pittsburgh , a far a i can tell - and delicious and cheap too . i ordered some mix of egg , bacon and pancake - and got 2 dinner-sized plate , one loaded with pancake and the other stuffed with egg , bacon , and home fry . oh , and a side of toast . for under $ 5 , if i recall.huge portion , all well-executed ; a good a deluca's.i have not had anything besides breakfast , so can not comment on the burger or anything else.cramped quarter , and you will have to wait , but when nothing but monster morning food will do , this is the destination .
okay , let is first set expectation . this place is a true dive ... this is not for the nyc foodie crowd . if you want a down home , large portion awesome breakfast , this is the place . the place is packed with happy diner , the server wa very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way . the best part - they have `` dippy '' egg on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order . for anyone who ha never heard of a `` dippy '' egg - this mean sunny side up or over medium where the egg are still runny and you can dip your bread in them . the egg were great - i ordered mine over medium , the breakfast potato were fab - no complicated additive like pepper or onion - just plain good potato cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh italian bread . yum ! ! !
i miss this place . when i return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktail the night before . when i think of pittsburgh , i remember cutting morning class in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of . honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner , and nowhere that i have been doe it a well a this joint . go here and you will be happy you did .
i have lived in pittsburgh for 6 year , and in carnegie for over 2 year , and by far , this is the best greasy spoon joint i have found . if you can stomach the wait ( no reservation , naturally ) , you will enjoy overflowing plate of goodness , thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made . here are the highlight : -cheap : breakfast for two can be well under $ 10 , with lunch around the same.-crowded : get there early and expect to wait . they close pretty early on the weekend too ( oddly , at 12:45pm ) -cash only-huge portion : when ordering fry or homefries , always get the half order , unless you are a lumberjack-about those homefries : they are often undercooked . i have had better , believe me . my favorite thing to eat in life are potato products.-my favorite item : hot sausage sandwich on thick italian toast , with cheese , lettuce , tomato and mayo
love this place . never had a bad meal . good portion and great people . be ready to stand in line .
my favorite breakfast place . have good sandwich also . stopped again for bfast and had the mixed grill -- get the small portion unless you are a real man ! mixed grill ha sausage , ( could it be ricci is ? ) , egg , onion , and home fry , soooo goooooooood ! use mancini is bread for toast , got the raisin toast - yum . have had many other item and just love the food . if you like to watch a true cook , sit at the counter . banter with the cook and staff and patron is fun ! lunch is good , sausage sandwich , hamburger and other lunch meat fried on the grill.gets busy for bfast so you may have to wait.remember it is a diner . do not expect fancy decor .
just left grab n eat , the food wa awesome and the service wa great . tiny place with a friendly atmosphere . the homemade italian toast is wonderful . i suggest the mix grill with a side of sausage , which is homemade .
definitely a greasy spoon ! always packed here and always a wait but worth it . the omelet are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage . i also like the mixed grill . my parent love their burger . took off a star for lumpy booth and really tight table ( your arm get hit when someone walk past ) oh and waitress are not very attentive .
great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel . reminds me of the one my parent used to own in mi . have fun finding a table on the weekend : )
great breakfast place . come hungry . look for dick , my dad , and gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi . try the mixed grill ( half ) .
ok , what is with all of these `` cash only '' place in pittsburgh ? i can appreciate that some smaller business might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant , but could you perhaps provide an atm ? in the past , this would deter me from eating at this place . looking at a standard breakfast menu , i decided to go with a tuna melt instead . what i got wa a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast . i had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal , but to no avail . one day later i can not even remember what my side wa . i suppose it did not leave much of an impression on me . i have to say that the dessert wa really good ! the cherry pecan pie ! i have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this wa awesome ! the cherry were not the sweet canned variety , but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar . i think i want to make this pie with my parent next harvest of our cherry tree ! my first impression is `` eh . '' i am learning how crazy pittsburghers are over breakfast ! seriously , waiting 30 minute for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that read a follows : `` 2 egg and toast $ x.xx '' '' 2 egg , meat , and toast $ x.xx '' '' 2 egg and pancake $ x.xx '' i 'd rather go to a denny is and order the `` create your own grand slam ! ''
best diner in the counrty ! ! ! we have been to many famous diner across the country and we still give gab and eat the best rating ! ! i wa a little intimidated when i first walked in and there wa like 2 pound of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill . if you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you , but everything i ate wa clearly the opposite of healthy . after trying like every meal they have i would recommend the mix grill ( half unless you are sharing ) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast . burger are great too.it is hard to find a place that make a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home , but this place doe it . the atmosphere is classy , old school americana .
best french toast ever ! ! love the friendly atmosphere , and especially the breakfast . never been disappointed . you have to try french toast with raisin bread too ... yummy !
great diner ! their breakfast is the best in the area ! lot of choice and always good . love the unique mug they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall . get there early otherwise you will not get a seat ! they have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast .
reader of my review may recall that i once referred to the dor-stop a possibly the best breakfast in pittsburgh . well , faithful follower , i must now admit that the dor-stop ha now been verified a only one of the best . why ? that is because gab and eat i have now found to be the best breakfast i have ever had . if it wa closer to my home i would quickly become a regular.i easily decided to order the mixed grill ( half ) . before i go on , i must ask ... ha anyone seen a full order ? because i honestly can not imagine how much food that is . i created my own with bacon , cheese , egg and potato . based on review i also opted to get a side of the sausage and wa pleased a punch when our waitress asked if i wanted hot or sweet ... .or one of each . i like variety , so i jumped on the change to try both . i also selected the italian toast - what other kind is there , really ? when my food arrived , it looked delicious . there wa so much bacon that after eating half of my mixed grill it looked like i 'd barely started . the sausage wa great , just do not ask me which one i liked best . my toast ? 4 thick slice that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both side . it wa a struggle , but i wa determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb . in case anyone is wondering , yes , they use real butter . i saw pound of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eye . the wait staff wa quick and efficient a well a helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people . the fact that none of the plate match and i noticed a sign at the front register that said , `` we need mug '' just make me love this place even more.a few tip : 1 . ) order the mixed grill . 2 . ) cash only ! 3 . ) gab and eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow ( or cozy if you will ) . i recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group . that way you will not feel rushed or crowded . 4 . ) get to gab and eat asap ! you will be glad you did !
classic breakfast joint . grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall . window is opaque due to the grease so you can not hardly see inside . on the outside , there are about a dozen people waiting to get in . when you finally do get inside , you see that there are 15 table and a counter , all occupied by people from all walk of life.what is the attraction behind this flea hole ? the food ! lot of it and dirt cheap . i sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill . potato , egg , sausage , bacon and italian toast . a giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover . i swear the full mixed grill had two pound of food . neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potato and egg frying in a pool of fresh grease . all that food , plus coffee and tip for around ten buck . cash only , so put that plastic away.only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the food network or travel channel will make this place famous , and then i will never be able to get in .
yum - freaking - me ! a the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only . a couple of recommendation : - do not eat early in the week - i do not recommend wearing any tight clothing ( no skinny jean ) - you will not be skinny when you leave i walked in for breakfast one early weekday am . the place wa packed with local and regular . a very good sign.my co-worker recommended i get the mixed grill . i ordered the large mix grill . my waitress tried to warn me - it is large ( very large ) . i ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.food - the mixed grill comprises their homemade sausage , grilled onion , grilled pepper , potato , fried egg . portion -this should have been a man v food episode . i wa not going to attempt to eat all the food . it wa really good.service - my waitress look a if she had been working there for year . she wa fast , friendly , and offered good advice.price - the cost range $ 5 - 10.i will definitely go back after i buy some new stretchy pant .
best breakfast spot in the area , if you like diner food it is the place to go . small , so you will want to avoid the church crowd on sunday , but the wait is never too long . everyone is friendly and ha obviously been working there for a while . if you are feeling like lunch food go a little later , their burger are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious .
good local spot to grab breakfast . good price for the amount of food you get . you can sit at the booth or at the counter
great breakfast , good price . you might have to stand outside in line though , so i do not really recommend winter time to go . lol . very friendly service , interesting coffee mug . they have great desert and such also . bring your cash though a they dont ' take card .
i always love a good diner . gab and eat wa just what we were looking for on a saturday morning . good food . great people . pittsburgh ambiance . this place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem . i had french toast and bacon . the french toast wa made with the best italian bread . my fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill . '' it consisted of egg , pepper , onion and home made sausage . not something you would eat everyday , but he loved it ! they also had great coffee . they actually ground up the bean in front of u . now that is fresh.we want to return sometime for `` turkey day . '' apparently they made fresh turkey every tuesday . now that sound good ! can not wait to return .
this is exactly what a breakfast place should be like -- comfortable , quirky , unpretentious and with inexpensive , large portioned working class breakfast plate .
on our current road trip of baseball , brew , hockey and diner , we decided to try gab & eat based on yelpers rating putting it # 1 for breakfast in pittsburgh area . we have to agree with most other reviewer that this is a place to eat.we arrived around noon on saturday and were happy there were a couple open table . the place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it . there is plenty of parking.inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time . country style decoration and sign are mixed with nostalgia sign & poster . most interesting are all the signature and comment written on the wall by past customer . we regretted not having a marker to add ours . the other highlight wa three large white board with trivia question - fun way to spend time waiting for food.the waitstaff there is ... uh , experienced . they are attentive , pleasant and efficient.after reading review i had to try the mixed grill . but s went with pancake with a side of bacon . the pancake were outstanding ... maybe the best either of u ha eaten . they were thick but with light texture and rich flavor . his bacon wa cooked just a requested - a crisp a possible - and very flavorful.the mixed grill is a mixed together concoction of egg , potato , onion , pepper , cheese , and spicy italian sausage grilled together . i am glad i heeded those who stressed going with the half size order . it filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order . i could not finish it all and that is rare . how do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough ? everything wa cooked well . the sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potato . you can build your own mix but the basic wa a good mix.my only complaint wa the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain . i like home fry with lot of seasoning that have aged on the grill . these potato were pretty uniform chunk with little seasoning . personal preference.it usually come with italian toast but they were out so i went with raisin . it wa delicious soft inch thick slices.coffee wa excellent and the cup stayed full . the total wa le than $ 15 . fabulous value for the quality and portions.while i can not say it is the best breakfast in pittsburgh ( only here 3 day ) , it the best so far and one of the best we have had .
met my nephew for lunch in carnegie and he suggested gab & eat . way to go justin ! the restaurant is in a strip mall across from the dairy queen . the grill is right up front so you can see them cooking . they have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4 . do not expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4 . they have a great looking breakfast menu . we all got burger of varying kind ! they were tasty ! the bun were buttered , toasted and soft . yum ! the amount of butter didnt bother me but it did my whiny mother . who whined even though there is a no whining sign a you walk in the door . we ordered fresh cut fry a onion ring . both of which were great . the half order wa plenty and a nice option to a full order . the restaurant wa full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign . i give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straw , silverware and napkin at u a she walked behind the counter . at least she did not throw the food when it came ! she also served the fry and onion ring way before our burger came out which wa kind of weird . they were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burger . it did not factor into my four star rating but i deduct a star from nephew because he invited u out to lunch then allowed me pay ! just kidding justin ! love ya !
this is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be : excellent breakfast in huge portion for cheap . i had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soonthe coffee wa good , totally serviceable diner coffee . the waitress wa wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table . the food wa excellent . the ambience wa exactly right for a diner . it wa packed . the wait wa not nearly a long a i wa expecting . 10 minute maybe.totally recommended . come hungry .
wow ! read the great review and i wa not let down . huge portion . the mixed grill wa the best breakfast i have ever had . if you go to pittsburgh it is a must eat . service wa superb . friendly staff . led zeppelin on the wall . ... ..what else could you ask for ?
i have been coming to gab n eat for almost 20 year and they have never let me down . i get a typical breakfast if egg , ham , toast , and home fry . delicious a usual . the ambience however is usually lacking . the wall are dark , with writing and signature of semi famous people all over the place . picture of local people hang on the wall ( i secretly want mine up there ) along with poster galore . while it fun to look at the first 10 time , it get a little boring after awhile . so today when i arrived i expected the same old experience . wow wa i wrong ! a soon a i looked at the door i knew something wa different . the place seemed lighter and brighter . to my pleasant surprise , they painted and got new counter top ! ! they are not quite done yet but the place ha a new happy vibe to it . the awesome breakfast , the new decor and the 5 guy sitting at the counter making me laugh are why i will be back ( maybe for lunch ) .
a gem . the coffee cup are mismatched . the owner is three foot away from me cooking . the sausage is made for them locally . and the food is frickin awesome . i had the pancake , my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich . cash only . friendly service .
excellent breakfast and lunch menu . friendly staff and super food . modest environment with excellent food . worth the wait.. dont miss this one . best breakfast and lunch food in the pgh south hill hand down .
what a find ! i stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business . the service is so friendly i thought i wa down south . the service wa quick , frankly and felt like i wa with family . fantastic poached egg , cajun homefries and crispy bacon . gab and eat is definitely a place i world recommend to local . i wa stuffed and the bill wa only $ 8.00 .
been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and i get the chance , and have never been disappointed ! the perfect blend of non-chain-tightly-packed ambiance , friendly older waitress who have been there since i started going , cheap for what you get price , and food with taste and amount that `` aunt bee '' would be proud of.never had anything that wa not hot , freshly made before my eye , and down home `` gooooooooooood '' ' a andy might say.as my wife and i agree , this `` joint '' , ha been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfast have been measured against ! one visit ... and you will be a believer , and most time i have been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself .
a fine breakfast joint . you got ta love the small diner . highly recommended .
gab n eat is the best breakfast in pittsburgh and always a treat . we went there around 11:30 which brought up the lunch . v breakfast debate . i saw another customer soup and knew i would have to try it . the soup wa a lobster bisque and it wa amazing ... ..creamy deliciousness . i could have had a quart of it . yum ! i ended up ordering the create your own mixed grill . ( when at gab n eat . you have to order the 1/2 grill ) i had mine with bacon . bacon wa crisp and delish . and m ordered the regular mixed grill . we also shared an order of potato pancake . they even brought u 2 side of applesauce and sour cream . the pancake could have been a tiny bit crisper , but still very good .
really just ok . it wa chaotic and no one alerted u to whether we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated , and when we tried to ask a woman working behind the counter , she gave u a dirty look like we were not welcome there . eventually we just sat down and someone came by to take our order . the server wa nice enough , but wa not very quick with the coffee refill - i finished my first cup slowly and then it sat empty for about five minute . food wa ok , but not amazing . we got the mixed grill and a pancake , and both were solid but not outstanding . not a bad place to go , but we probably will not go out of our way to go here again , either .
sadly , i have only been here twice , only due to the fact it is not really close to my home or work . however , when i am in the area , this is a great cheap eats for both lunch and breakfast . it almost like going back in time to where the old style local diner or isaly is to get made to order diner style food . love the egg made perfectly to order and a variety of lunch offering at extremely affordable price . i only wish gab & eat would move to my neighborhood .
this place is divey but cute . the food is obviously not five-star , but it is a great place if you want to get a good , hearty breakfast . we went there for lunch and got burger ... oddly enough the server said that they do not sell french fry on sunday ... .. ? so we had to settle for home fry . i thought it wa a little weird at first , but damn , those home fry were good ! i did not even care after that . the coffee is great too ! it is a unique little place . it is basically one long strip of a kitchen , then booth set up right beside it ! they also have a pretty cool breakfast bar where you can sit and watch them grill all of the food to order . the coffee cup did not match - they were all christmas mug lol - they have a wall in the back where you can sign your name with a dry erase marker , and they have little trivia board on the wall just for fun . it is definitely a place of it is own kind . the price are very reasonable , and i would definitely go back again .
great food , great service , and a great `` diner '' atmosphere . it is the kind of place that allows you to decompress and enjoy good conversation with friend .
one of my favorite breakfast stop in pittsburgh ! can not beat the hometown feel of this place . always had great service .
we came here once before and remember it not being very good , but figured we 'd give it another shot since it is pretty close to our home . it is still just ok. we did not have to wait this time ( saturday morning at 10:30 ) , but there wa a wait throughout the time we were there . the menu is very basic- no specialty pancake , waffle , or french toast and only 1 specialty omelette . there were no meal option , so if you want home fry or something , it is extra . the omelette do include toast . ( great bread , btw ! ) we had to wait a while for our food , which wa surprising because we have been to a lot of diner . my husband and i both got omelette and agreed that the content were not really cooked with the egg . it is almost like the egg wa completely cooked and someone threw the cooked content in there and just folded it over . a for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese wa lacking . my biggest peev about this place is that it is cash only . perhaps i missed it , but i am pretty sure this wa not noted anywhere on the menu or the front door . thankfully , we had enough to cover our bill , but is not a good way to end the meal when you are scrambling and digging for change . there are a lot of good diner in the area , so i doubt we will be going back .
one of those place you only hear about from a friend ... tucked in a strip mall ... only open for breakfast and lunch . the local atmosphere surpasses the food and that is a helluva compliment . mixed grill is the choice for breakfast . they will mix and match meat and how you want your egg along with toast . their burger are up there with the best in pittsburgh . a hidden gem . do not miss it .
the best breakfast place by far . i never even liked breakfast food until trying their egg and french toast .
great greasy spoon ! arrived early , around 7:15 am on a weekday . had no trouble finding a seat . just a we were sitting down , a waitress asked if we wanted coffee . of course , and how lovely ! we had a couple of question about the mixed grill size because we did not want too much , a the review here stated that the portion were huge . the waitress wa super nice and answered all of our question . we ended up splitting the half-sized mixed grill , and it wa plenty ! great diner quality , but i think i will try the same dish without the cheese next time-it wa an american cheese , and i do not think the grill needed it . coffee wa always hot , and service wa so quick ! this place is a hot spot ! cash only - be prepared .
wonderful omelet , coffee , and staff ! the price are great and the food is prepared quickly ! veggie omelet with cheese is my favorite !
a lot of food for a great price . been eating here for year . they only take cash so make sure you stop by the atm on your way there !
my friend and i stopped in yesterday for breakfast . we originally came to carnegie to eat at another new breakfast spot , but they had an hour wait and we had some retail therapy to handle stat . gab & eat crossed my mind since i had bookmarked it on yelp.. over 2 year ago . there wa a tiny wait here.. about 2 couple in front of u . finally 2 seat at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.surprisingly we both ordered the same thing.. mixed grill . mine had sausage link and she decided on bacon . it wa a blast watching all the food being made right before our eye . giant club sandwich , super thick pancake , egg egg and more eggs.. it wa a fun time . the restaurant is literally a hole in the wall but had good customer service and delicious food . my only complaint is that i ordered my mixed grill with cheese . i thought it wa going to be shredded cheddar , but they put 3 slice of american on it . eh i will know better next time .
they have done it again ! excellent little establishment with their home town feeling . mix match coffee mug , smiling waitress , open front diner kitchen feel . went in there in the mood for lunch while my date wa craving breakfast . it is a seat your own kinda establishment , so we found a table at the very far back , sat down and were greater right away and asked if we wanted coffee to start out morning . agreed and both cup were promptly filled and re filled a the meal went along without hesitation . i ordered the hot italian , had fried salami and bologna on it with cheese , dressing , and lettuce ... . bun wa a smidge small for all the goody in it but what is to complain about there ? my date got the bagel sandwich and `` hey rayed '' it ( adding breakfast potato and cole slaw ) it wa amazing and large enough that she now ha lunch a well . i also got a cup the chicken poblano soup , pretty fantastic ! always a great place to travel to , always a good story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the local , always great and friendly . highly recommend !
this place is great . best ham and cheese inlet i have ever had ! their burger are also delicious . nice flat-top crust on the burger . i only wish they were open for dinner too !
this place is by far the best place for breakfast ... .but today ... i decided to get lunch . { only because it wa lunch time ... but they do serve breakfast at this time , too . } . i got the turkey club on wholewheat ... omg ... it wa delish . too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made french fry . if you are really hungry and do not count calorie ... make a stop here .
old and need remodeling , but the food is good , the worker are very friendly and we love going there ! !
my favorite breakfast joint of all time . awesome coffee , pancake , waffle , sausage ... you name it . the service is what you 'd expect it to be . : ) love love love this place . you will more then likely have to wait for a seat on a weekend . well worth the wait .
cheap and delicious breakfast ! i know it is strange to say , but they make the best toast . i typically do not eat my toast at breakfast , but here , it is my favorite part . i either get the ham and half waffle or ham , italian toast and 1 egg scrambled . the wait staff is very casual and friendly.just be prepared to go for the food , not the atmosphere .
used to love this place . people are nice and friendly . excellent food great pancake only stopped going after finding a roach in my potato it is a shame the place wa one of my favorite . bit can not go back after that experience
this is our favorite breakfast spot . fast friendly service . you get more than what you pay for . awesome !
my husband and i used to go to gab and eat all of the time , and would always take out of towner here . that last time we went we did something we have never done before and that wa walk out ! my omelet wa not cooked and it wa runny , i asked for cheddar cheese and got american , my husband ordered a medium rare hamburger and got a burnt paper thin patty . when we told the waitress she sent the cook over and he gave u attitude and wa a total jerk . he wanted to put my omelet in the microwave . if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
i stopped in here due to a change in luncheon plan . upon arrival the wait to be seated wa horrific ! someone pointed to an empty counter stool so i sat there . i perused the menu fairly quick and decided to order half portion . i had not had a waffle in age and i love home fries.since they both came in half portion i went with those . my waitress made sure i always had a fresh cup of hot tea since i wa sitting near the entrance . it seemed like a long production line to wait for your order but it did not disappoint . when i got my half order i wa overwhelmed at the size ! the waffle wa thick and fluffy and the home fry which bore a resemblance to hash brown were hot and greasy . ketchup is on the counter a well a syrup . yes they use real butter here since i could observe one of the chef using a giant slab of it in preparation of orders.i definitely plan to revisit this place when i have more time to try different thing . my advice would be to prepare to take home a doggy bag since they give huge portion even if they are half size . the best part is that price here are very reasonable and you can get a lot of food for what you order.gab and eat is located in a small strip mall just on the cusp of the entrance to carnegie . it is easy to miss if you are looking for a particular building .
very cute , little dive place ( with an emphasis on little ) . breakfast meal are my favorite . so , i thought everything on the menu looked delicious . i ended up ordering a breakfast bagel sandwich . i could not have made it any better myself . my mom ordered the half portion of the mixed grill which wa a medley of sweet and spicy sausage , egg , home fry , and pepper . i also ordered a half portion of french fry , and they were absolutely perfect . these are my definition of the best kind of french fry . they are fresh cut , with the skin still on them.we were in and out within 30 minute with our stomach full and happy . they only take cash though . so make sure you have some green in your wallet before you stop by .
i would give this a solid one star . let me tell you about my experience ... i walk in to a nasty glare by one of the waitress before seating myself at a table covered in advertisement and a woman throwing menu at u before walking away.the waitress wa a sweet old woman.she wa nice , but hard of hearing and unattentive.here is what i ordered : two egg white scrambled , link , italian toast , and a half order of home fries.here is what i got : two scrambled whole egg , italian toast , and home fries.i addressed the missing link with the waitress and she asked me if i still wanted them . i wa starved by this point and said yes . i heard her to go the chef and ask for them , to which the woman behind the grill screamed , `` for what ? do you have the slip ? where is it ? where doe it say link ? '' in a considerably nasty tone.the egg were mediocre , the home fry were unevenly cooked ( mostly uncooked potato chunk , some practically ash ) , the link were so tasteless i stopped eating them a soon a i recognized i wa full , but the toast wa lovely.the price are ok , but i 'd prefer a college student is hungover cooking to coming back here.update:30 minute after leaving i got a vicious headache.500 milligram of acetaminophen later , my headache ha gotten worse , new unpleasant symptom have come along , and i may have contracted food poisoning.update 2 : i have food poisoning . 100 % definitely food poisoning . i have not eaten anything but pretzel rod and nutrition bar before breakfast here since 1pm the day before . i obviously have not eaten since . there is actually no other place i could have contracted it .
breakfast wa real good . toast wa great . 3 of u all liked our food . plus got sandwich to go . lot of food for a reasonable price . may have to wait to be seated . great small diner . will return again .
trash.if you have got time to explain to me for 2 minute why you are too busy to take a to-go order , you have got time to write down my order and start making it . guess who wa not too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
best i can say is that it is ok . very small and compact . i went with my one and a half year old daughter and the booth are so crammed in that there is no room for high chair ( pretty sure they do not even have high chair ) . they did have booster seat , but it wa not ideal.food wa ok . nothing special . i had sausage and cheese omlette and got a pancake for my daughter . again , just ok.it wa hot in there and i do not think they have ac . there wa a fan in front , but that did little for u who where sitting in the back.this place is cash only . i did not see anything on my way in stating that , but i could have missed it . it doe not say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either . there is an atm , but it ha a $ 2 charge to use . can not believe a place in 2016 doe not take cards.probably will not ever go back since there are similar breakfast place closer to where i live that are more kid friendly , have better food and ac and accept more than just cash .
sometimes you just do not need a fancy shmancy over-priced frilly frittata-ed brunch to get the job done . sometimes you just want a greasy spoon diner that know how to fry up some good breakfast.i love this place . the booth are falling apart , the waitress are not overly nice , and it is chaotic . but i can design my perfect breakfast because they serve half waffle and single french toast ! i hate having to choose between sweet and savory breakfast and , at gab & eat , you do not have to . everything i have eaten here ha been very good . waffle = gooood . sausage patties= gooood . mixed grill = gooooood . pepper , onion , sausage , cheese , and potato omelet = so so so good . you really can not go wrong here . it is a great place for cheap eats !
barb is country junction get a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a pittsburgh restaurant should be . in addition to being the apple of my nostalgia is eye , it is also the constant thought of my tummy when i am hungry on the weekend . barb is breakfast can not be beat , but truly any meal you get there you will not regret . everything is made to order , with fair portion , and great price . my recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee . there is nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma is kitchen.i know that gab n eat is nearby , and barb is can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of carnegie that you have got ta try !
great little place . treat you like a local.eaten here 3 time a week for a month . same overtime . barb is always here .
this is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly . i live right down the street from here but unfortunately , i have only gone a once . trust me , i will go here more often . the food is great , price are low , and the staff are friendly . my cousin and i wanted a place to eat and catch up and this wa perfect place . i will go here more often .
my first time going to barb is country junction and i really wanted to like this place , i really did ... however , i didn't.the food wa decent , some wa above average and some below but it wa overall decent . i got pancake , bacon and egg . the pancake were really good and fluffy , the home fry were simply okay and the egg were not cooked well . my son had a burger and it wa good . the coffee at this place wa brewed to perfection which a appreciate . i would give the food 3/5.the service wa subpar for sure . while our waitress wa a really nice girl , she wa not on top of anything at all . had to ask for coffee refill , had to ask for silverware , for napkin ... etc . she got the order messed up and so on . i give the service 2/5.the inside of the place had some country charm a you 'd expect but want particularly cleanly . it also had a leaky roof in several place which had bucket collecting the water . a customer even tripped over the bucket and fell . i give the interior 2/5.the price were decent . i fed my whole family breakfast ( 3 of u ) for $ 23 . i give the price 3/5.so in summary , you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any mean . there are better diner in the area that i will patronize in the future rather than barb is .
we go to barb is every weekend and have for the past 3 year . the food is great , the price are better , and the coffee is the best ! try the barb wire omlette or the chocolate chip pancake !
my husband and i tried this place for the first time today . it wa easy to find and no problem with parking . it is `` seat yourself '' , but there were no sign stating this , so we stood there looking like fool for a minute . it took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge u and i am guessing that this wa barb . she apologized and said that one of her worker called off today . no big deal and her apology wa appreciated . she came back with our drink , dropped them off , and left again . we did not see her for another 20 minute . ultimately , we were there for 30 minute before she took our order . this wa aggravating to me . i do not mind waiting for my food if i know it is going to be awesome and they are making it with love , but come on now . we ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage . the food wa alright , really nothing special . a new waitress ended up taking care of u and she wa much more attentive . we may or may not go back .
i love this place ! barb is such an amazing person , so down to earth and everything is homemade !
never very busy . food is great but sometimes take a bit longer than other place , worth the wait though !
for the price i ended up paying , this place wa fine . there wa a full kitchen , king bed and tv . i wa just surprised at the lack of amenity at the hotel . while i have stayed at other extended stay hotel , i wa surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per week ... if you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it . if you needed fresh towel , you 'd have to go to the main desk to get them . they also only provided a small bar of soap in the room ... not the typical soap , shampoo , lotion , etc . this did not bother me too much a i wa only staying a couple day but again i found it surprising not to have these basic thing . the hotel in general wa easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from . the hotel wa clean and the people who worked there were very nice .
great value , close drive to city , not much to do around hotel , it a business park . carnegie city ha a few bar and restaurant .
simplerusticlocalwait that is every gordon ramsey reviewmy experience at extended stay america wa great . the staff wa warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning a i left and when i returned in the evening . they went out of their way to provide a confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurant and nightspot when needed . if i ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel i would not hesitate to head back there .
i have stayed at a couple of extended stay site that i found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just a good . excellent place to stay while visiting pittsburgh . it is just a five minute drive to downtown . location is in a business park area so it is quiet . the room contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator , sink , cabinet and two burner . there is no oven which i expected a the description all state `` full kitchen '' so be aware of that . also they do not keep the dish , pot and pan , coffee maker , toaster or utensil in the room . if you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in . the room wa clean and well maintained . cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable . the free wifi is usually fast . the best part about this location wa the staff . the people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any question or issue with a smile . i would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it .
tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful
front desk get 4 startshowever , if you are looking for a good night of sleep , you may not get it . the refrigerator made a lot of noise at night every time the compress kicked on . likewise with the air conditioner . if you did not bring a hair dryer , you will have to get it at the front desk . there is a sofa bed but no extra pillow nor blanket .
thomas darbyi will never stay at this extended stay america due to the fact that we were there in october , 2015 and had an awful stay ! room wa only cleaned one time after asking three time when it would be cleaned . there wa absolutely nothing in the supposedly full kitchen , 2 wash clothes , 2 hand towel and 2 towel . we had to take used wash clothes and towel to front desk every day to receive fresh one . the toilet ran over and the heater did not work until we decided to leave . we were over charged after booking through hotels.com and had to put up a $ 100.00 deposit . for what ? never again will we stay there ! ! ! ! !
visiting from california i stayed in motel 6 for two day and i wa not happy with it . motel 6 did not even had a shampoo . my boyfriend encouraged me to stay in this hotel where i can cook instead of spending money at restaurant . only regret i have is i should have stayed here instead of motel 6 . i wa able to stay 1 night 2 day . and i honestly loved it . they even had iron and board that wa useful . they also gave me military discount .
we traveled to pittsburgh for a wedding and chose to stay at this extended stay . the photo were nice , and the review were decent . front desk staff is very friendly and the room ha spacious and laid out well and that is about it . the room wa non smoking , which is clear that no one ever followed that rule . it stank so bad of smoke in there that when i came home , i had to wash my clean clothes because they smelled of smoke a well . not to mention my allergy were in full effect . the bathroom wa so inconvenient to get in and out of . the door opened to about 1cm from the toilet so you have to wedge yourself between the door and sink . breakfast wa pathetic . there wa a row of fruit and a row of store bought muffin and a couple thing of coffee , that is it . i will be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
room were great big , bathroom is very hard to get out of like other review have stated . i never remembered getting breakfast at extended stay thanks because you really do not coffee and granola bar is it . the staff wa awesome and very helpful ! the only reason 5 star were not given is because we stayed here because of convince to pittsburgh well the freeway is currently closed june 2016 so it took u 30 minute through neighborhood and windy little road to get in and out of hotel . wish we were notified before ! otherwise great stay and clean room !
i have said it on other site and will repeat here . you must try their burger . they are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect . another must are the fry with guinness gravy and if you have not had enough go for the ultimate sleeper , leek and potato soup . authentic black & tan . harp and murphy on tap . it do not get no better . this is a true gem my friend .
let me start.. the service wa a little sketchy , but the beer wa cold and the food wa amazing . i would recommend paddy is to anyone .
be warned . do not expect the best service ever . it is not the cleanest place you have been in either . the decor is soccer jersey from place and team you have probably never heard of . it is divey , eclectic , and authentic . if you are looking for good irish food and a cold pint , you can not go wrong at the pour house . like most of carnegie is main st , this is a hidden gem worth seeking out . they have some of the best irish food i have had in pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd is pie is out of this world . if you are not looking for irish food , then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheese together . it is big and the cheese is thick and gooey . i get it with a side of potato pancake ... yum . also , they have guinness , smithwicks and harp on tap ...
if i could give this place le than one star , i would . i have no idea who gave this place high review but they must either own the place or be time traveler from back in the day when this place might not have sucked . the decor is tired and grimy , the place reeked of smoke , and the bartender/server wa surly , to put it mildly . we went there on a saturday night with a mind to try the irish food . apparently , we were out of luck . i have always thought that the secret of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat . he told u before we ordered that they had no `` pie '' . no chicken pot pie , no shepherd pie , etc . so , we gamely tried to order other thing . we placed our order . my wife , for example , ordered the irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling u they were out of that and even more thing for several people in our party . at that point my wife picked out a third option , ham and cabbage , only to be told again that `` they were out '' . at that point , realizing that the only food to be had in the place wa what wa crusted on the menu , we asked to pay for our drink and left . they actually then gave u flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card . in short , unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression , i 'd probably avoid this place like the plague . speaking of the plague , i suppose we should thank mr. surly for inspiring u to walk out . i only have two bathroom at my house and would have been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once .
best irish food in the burgh . great bar food too . the service is maybe a bit surly and it is not the cleanest , nor the best decor . but , that is not what this place is about . it is a town irish bar and it serf great solid irish fare and suds to the local . and it doe it better than anyone . i go back again and again .
it look so much better in here since they changed from paddy is to riley is . it is a shame , however , that they had to keep that same curmudgeon of a bartender that ruin the experience . can somebody notify me once they get rid of him ?
okay , so hopefully you have not been enjoying happy hour @ riley is pour house before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting irish owner . to recap : murphy is pour house from 1979-1985 . sullivan is pour house from 1995-2002 . paddy is pour house from 2002-2012 . and , bagpipe please , riley is pour house open march 1 of 2012 . still with me ? it is a tiny long bar just like the old irish pub . no more smoking allowed . hurrah ! ! ! same lousy service . my guess is that the entire place need ( no , strike that ... . demand ) an automated food/beverage ticketing system . none of the cook , bartender , or waitress know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table . it is actually pretty funny if you are not a ) hungry or b ) thirsty . i really really want this place to do better . we need more irish pub and local old time watering hole . get it together , murphy is ... er , i mean sullivan is ... .er , i mean paddy is or is it riley is ? ; ) . whatever the case , they have cold guinness . and irish music . and fun patron .
the delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell , having confused 133 and 113.rather than taking a step back and analyzing the situation , he begin to accuse my wife and i of ordering and refusing to pay for this pizza.the driver then get on his cell phone and rather than calling the number than wa given when the order wa placed , begin to call his boss and start threatening me with felony charge . so i take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the order-er wa , phone my neighbor and discover the mistake . rather than a thank you or a sorry , he just speed off ( breaking the speed limit on our block ) to reach his destination 50 foot away.i would call to complain , but based on the other review , it clear the owner do not care about carnegie or it is resident , and it pretty well known around town just how awful their food is , so it would be pointless to boycott a place i 'd never order from again anyway.do yourself a favor and order from any other establishment in town .
3/6/12 visit - i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco . - this place wa dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive . the food wa really good and my group ordered a bunch of different thing it wa all good- a- taste.- price are reasonable a- . -- -- -- -- they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong.sweet potatoe fry a+pizza - aeggplant hoagie b+greek salad b+gyro a+if they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star ****
recommended . 16 inch pizza on special wa cheap . fast service . not the best pizza but above average .
some of the worst pizza i have ever had . we used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut sicilian . first of all the pizza wa not even cut through , and the sad attempt at cutting wa so uneven that 4 of the slice were about an inch wide , while the others were about 4 '' each . the topping were scarce , they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza . the onion were huge chunk and the mushroom were straight from a can . the worst part though wa the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll . i am serious ... it wa so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough wa bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it . it wa gross . we also ordered steak and italian hoagy . the veggie were old and wilted , and there wa no dressing on either . the italian had deli meat that wa clearly bottom of the line and not very generous . the `` steak '' ( if you an call it that ) wa greyish instead of brown and looked like it wa a processed meat chopped into piece . no flavor or seasoning and the texture wa reminiscent of spam . it wa so bad that i only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest . i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed . i thought i would give them another try since i 'd never ordered a sicilian pizza from there . what a mistake . i will never order from them again !
having certain business with skill set in your local neighborhood is important . i try to keep it a local a possible , so when i heard about a tailor in carnegie i wa intrigued . the building is in a strip mall across from carnegie coffee company . unassuming , look like it is closed all the time , until you do a drive by and see the hour posted . there is a latino man in his 20 is working when you arrive . in my mind , i imagine a tailor to be older , kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck ( textbook movie tailor ) , so i wa a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing . he asks you to go change into a closet ( yes , a closet to change in with one lightbulb ) but all my worry aside , the moment he started working on my item i knew he wa the real deal . he learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew . and he doe thing the correct way . meaning , for example- i took in a pair of khaki all the way down to the cuff , but he seamed them up to look exactly the way they were when i first bought them . most placed will have bulge and pucker . the rest of my item were just a perfect . very inexpensive at $ 10 for a pair of pant to adjust the hem . the item were done in a timely manner . he take his business very seriously . while i wa there , i watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirt to be altered in an hour , and he did it and charged the same price . really nice guy , please go and support this business to keep him around town !
new to area and decided to pay this shop a visit ! it wa definitely the best experience i have ever had with a tailor . he is much cheaper than the other shop , he charge 10 while others charge $ 15 , and he go above and beyond for what he charges.i dropped off 4 jean , and he hemmed and tapered the jean ! i could not even tell the difference between the store bought jean and the quality of his work . it wa absolutely perfect , no bulge or pucker ! they the match the exact stitch a the factory . absolutely a great guy , they were all done and waiting for me a promised ! i will definitely be taking all of my business to this place , and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually care about his work and building an honest business .
i needed alteration done to my suit very quickly . like three day quickly . not only did filberto at alteration world have it ready , the price wa beyond reasonable and the work wa excellent ! i plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.oh and he let me know that they also dry-clean . wonderful shop !
this is the best alteration place i have been to . the guy that owns it is extremely helpful and work fast . also , the price are so reasonable i wonder how he stay in business . he wa able to do an alteration on short notice and wa very acommodating . the alteration i needed done -- and fast -- wa right in the middle of prom season . all the other place i called gave me a several week wait , but he took me right away . i will be back !
i just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite penguin fleece jacket and a pair of suit pant hemmed . the price wa very reasonable and the work done wa great . i will go back for all my tailoring need and highly recommend if you need any done .
so happy i found this place ! i am new to the pittsburgh area and wa not sure if it wa worth driving to carnegie to come here , but yelp convinced me . it wa completely worth the trip ! since it would have been a long trip to come back , the guy at alteration world finished my work ( patching a hole on a pair of jean ) in le than half an hour ( i killed time at an adorable coffee shop across the street ) and exactly a i had specified . oh , and the price wa extremely reasonable a well . thanks yelp for another great find !
my bridesmaid dress alteration were perfect . i would not hesitate to come back for alteration or dry cleaning .
the service , quality , and speed of alteration world are incredible ! i have had suit and pant altered here and have been thoroughly impressed by the work . everything ha fit perfectly and the work wa quality . i will be returning here exclusively for my tailoring need and have referred many customer already . if you need anything altered ( or even something custom made ) , do not hesitate to go to alteration world .
i have taken thing here before and loved how `` reasonably priced '' they are . my most resent experience here wa so horrible my family and i will never go back . the business is not run the way it ha been in the past . i took a dress that needed taken in in the back and around the neck . when i went to pick it up it wa not even ready then to find out the next day that i wa being charged $ 60 . my family and i have been coming here for a few year and never ever spent anything even remotely close to $ 60 worth on alteration . my mom came down to pick up two thing right before and and her total wa $ 25 ... not only are the price extremely inconsistent when i finally got the dress the neck wa still way too loose and the zipper did not go up all the way i had to pin the dress myself and wear it with safety pin to a wedding . i wa not able to get my money back because apparently `` it wa not his fault '' and he told me not to worry about it . this is probably the worst business in carnegie . is it possible to give zero star ?
are you are really looking at the review for ljs ? it fried stuff , with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat . you will regret eating it 30 minute after you finish , but it is delicious .
i agree with paul on this one . but i had to stop here on my way home from work tonight . ( i think i feel my heart yelling at me again ) , the gal at the drive thru window wa just soooo sweet , i just might go back and ask her to marry me ! but then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online . maybe she just wanted my positive response . ok sarah b. you got it ... now where is my free coke ?
it is deep fried garbage ... .it is los c'mon what do you expect ... ..however i have never had better , friendlier service at a fast food restaurant .
i love ljs and have to agree , service wa decent here . i tried a piece of my kid is chicken ( i only ever get the fish for myself ) and wa pleasantly surprised to find white breast meat ( same chicken texture a chick fil a ) . a little grimy dining room , and the bathroom handle is broken 8/2015 ... it would be nice if they made it an a & w-ljs but as-is still work for me .
i love ljs , but i had to write a review regarding this particular location . the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for . it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door . it took about 15 min for the food , so i figured it wa gon na be all fresh ... negative ! the fish wa old and cold and fry were a very soft . the corn lacked butter.i did not care for the onion ring and my boyfriend said the coleslaw tasted spoiled.the chicken plank and hushpuppy were the only thing edible . service wa not too bad - nice people . too bad a whole bunch of fly started flying around the dining area and prep area , which ruined my appetite .
by far the worst most unprofessional dentist i have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap opera on all the tv in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which wa too deep which could have been understandable a her son had his picture delivered from hawaii and she had to stop 3 time to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to hawaii on her mom dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen i had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth wa the result i would not recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone i hate because of the three month of extreme tooth pain i had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after i called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care le and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotic do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled ! !
when i moved to the area , dr. weinberg wa recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for year . i have had nothing but positive experience with her and her staff since seeing her two year ago . the team is professional , nice and courteous . i recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating . my daughter look forward to coming to the dentist so that is saying something . i do wish they would turn off fox news in the lobby a i 'd rather watch paint dry but ... nobody is perfect .
in all fairness - i did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minute for them to open.when i look at yelp review , i usually weed out the outlier ( the best and the worst ) . unfortunately , there are only two reviews.it wa my first time at the office . the office admin ( very nice ) asked for me to come early ( before 9am ) to complete paperwork . i arrived at 8:50 . i waited . i watched 2 employee walk by me ( unlocked the door and re-locked it ) . they did not acknowledge me.the door i wa at had signage ( open hour ) . i decided to leave because of a review where the staff seemed distracted or disinterested in my presence.the office admin ( very nice ) called me to inform i am missing my appointment . i explained to her that there were too many indication where this wa not going to be a good fit and wished her the best of luck.i recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door ( furthest away from the parking lot ) for the entrance.poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which wa pointed out in a previous review .
i have been to this office a good amount of time . each time the receptionist give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable . dr. weinberg herself is very nice , but i doubt her ability . every procedure she ha done to my teeth ha backfired . the third and last issue i have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visit and somehow i have received an invoice for $ 55 . i called and of course the receptionist wa sassy and rude so i gave up . will never go back or refer anyone else
my family ( husband and 3 young child ) have been seeing dr. weinberg for a few year . we have never had an issue . she is great with the kid , even my 6 year old who ha autism . scheduling and rescheduling appts is `` fine '' , the wait time is fine , the care is fine . basically i have had no issue , but i have not had my sock blown off either . it is the dentist , it is what it is . i do find the dentist to be a bit frazzle , but we have never had an issue .
all i need to say is that my 6 year old could not wait to see dr. weinberg and her staff ! not only are they professional and kind , they have made my child have a life time of good oral health care ! this busy mom love that they can provide two appointment , at the same time . i can not imagine having a better family dentist !
just moved to the area and needed a dentist after getting my front tooth chipped playing hockey . she did an amazing job at fix my tooth and cleaned up the front teeth while doing it . i wa able to get in and have my tooth fixed within a few day of it happening . i have gotten a few filling a well after my chip wa fixed . the doctor is great and so are the staff . i would recommend going here .
don don is a restaurant i find myself missing now and again , it is probably my favorite restaurant in carnegie . simple setup , just a small restaurant with a few table and a tv . oddly enough i think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup , never had better . the food is average but i always enjoyed eating there , great service and a cheap place to get chinese food .
take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost . the only time i go is when i am starved and do not have the energy to cook or get edible food . and then after i have been kicking myself .
don don is atleast a good a ( although i personally happen to think better than ) the majority of inexpensive chinese place best equiped for delivery and take out . i have frequented many similar establishment in different part of thecountry , and have also spent a few year in japan . sound odd , but they have some amazing chinese food out there .
far away from real chinese food . doe not even taste good a american style chinese food .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so . the food taste average and the price is good . it is your typical low-end chinese place . the last ( and final ) time i ordered here i just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department wa making his round . while i wa waiting on my food ( which took much longer than usual ) the inspector wa pointing out violation . he also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register wa unable to produce . the inspector looked at me like i wa crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor condition . a for the rest of the place - it is always been kind of dirty inside . the carpet are just filthy and the wall match . there are always child is toy scattered about the floor because the owner child are always there , so be careful not to trip . the worker do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it come to cleanliness don don is lacking .
delicious singapore noodle and seafood delight . crispy flavorful crab rangoon , and cold sesame noodle done well ( but could have used a bit more sauce ) . excellent real chinese food , friendly service . restaurant ambience : high school cheap date quality .
i came here with two friend prior to visiting apis meadery next door this past weekend . i ordered the general tso is chicken , and my friend ordered the sesame chicken , crab rangoon , and another appetizer ( egg roll ? ) . they ordered the combo with le meat , and i ordered the one with more -- the name were very similar , which i found confusing . the food took quite a while to come up ( ~15 min . ) , so i 'd suggest calling ahead if you are in a rush . while we were waiting , the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in chinese , and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery ( probably the same person ) .to be honest , i am not much of a fan of americanized chinese cuisine ( i lived in singapore for 3 mo . and have visited hong king and japan ) ; it is been awhile since i have had it , and this dish reminded me why . i do not care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce , nor do i care for the pre-cut meat in the dish ( i like to cut up my own meat , thank you very much ) , so the flavor and texture do not do much for me . having said that , my friend claimed this wa the best americanized chinese fare they 'd had in pgh ( and they live in squirrel hill ! ) , so if you are a fan of this cuisine , you can take that into consideration.if nothing else , this meal provided u with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead , which i appreciated .
i use to order here fairly often . the past 2 year their food ha been getting progressively worse every time i order . it doe not help that the owner that always is at the register is so rude to me every time . i finally decided that i am done . i do not think i should feel let an inconvenience when ordering food from a restaurant . let alone one that the food is not even that good . also the inside is dirty a heck . they can deliver food in a bmw but they can not buy a scrub brush ? i have found golden dragon in collier square is 100 time better then don don .
we visited don don chinese restaurant in carnegie a while back because we had the entertainment book coupon for buy one dinner get one complimentary dinner.we ordered 2 regular dinner . at the end when we went to check out and pay , the owner refused to honor the entertainment book coupon and offered a fruit cup instead , which we refused . the food wa acceptable , but refusing to accept the entertainment book coupon wa not acceptable . needle to say , we never returned .
i took my sick cat here and they charged me $ $ $ $ for blood work and then never called me with result . i had to chase down the result and finally spoke to a different vet than the one who examined my cat . he said my cat `` absolutely did not have hyperthyroid '' . they said my cat is problem were behavioral and were rude and dismissive of my concern . i finally took my cat to another vet who diagnosed him with hyperthyroidism . i am trying medication now and i hope the illness ha not progressed too far . otherwise i will have to have him put to sleep . do not take your cat here .
i had gone here year ago and hated it . the doctor were not very nice or caring . however , i wa not happy with my current vet and decided to give the place another chance because i saw that all of the veterinarian had changed and the location is so convenient for me . i am so happy i did ! the doctor wa great . we saw dr. martinovich after we adopted our new dog . she wa so wonderful with him . she clearly love animal . she wa gentle with him and very thorough . the cost wa higher than i had hoped but for the experience , i did not mind . i will absolutely go back and plan on taking both of my cat here at some point a well . very pleased ! great place. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -update : every single time we have gone to this place we have been satisfied . seen quickly and gotten great care for our pet . dr. lasota is wonderful ! we will not ever be going anywhere else if we can help it !
went for breakfast on 6/16/14 . we received very good service and meal came within a few minutes.waitress could have smiled more but wa friendly . i had a grand slam ... it wa more than enough food . meal wa very tasty ... we will definitely go back . it is a popular denny is .
i love their stake and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak , it is completely delicious ! great atmosphere , there is always a lot people and the waiter are nice ; food portion is great a well !
perfect time with hubby , after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot nice meal , waitress wa such an adorable girl . her arm wa broken or smth but she still dis a great job ! strawberry lemonade wa just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not know what it wa : ) strawberry milkshake , nacho and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering ! it always nice when u go late at night like u , it is not crowded , not noisy , nice music playing and always nice people around . if you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say denny is !
this location never disappoints ! ! food is always consistently great , and if you come at the right time , ( witching hour ) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back . and it is awesome ! ! love this place ! !
dude ... it is denny is . it is excellent drunk food , packed on sunday morning , not very good.. but not really bad either . it is denny is . when you walk into a denny's.. you know exactly what you are getting into . why the heck are you even reading review about a denny is ? that is like looking for review on an ice cream truck , you are getting the same thing no matter which one you choose .
excellent food , good service too i have had several different dish here and all have been excellent
chose denny is for a very late ( 1:30pm ) sunday brunch . no wait . quickly greeted and served . i ordered the half size of moon over my hammy . it wa just the right amount of food for me , and the hash brown were delicious ! only thing lacking wa frank is red hot : - ) son and husband very pleased with their meal , can not remember the name but see pic . patron next to u gave u $ 5 off $ 20 check , so our total came to $ 16 ! would go back again for a casual meal .
i like the food at denny is more than meal served at pricier restaurant . my favorite is the bourbon chicken skillet . even though it is not advertised a being gluten-free , it doe not have any ingredient containing wheat- just chicken , potato , and broccoli in a yummy jack daniel sauce . both eat n park and max and erma is have gone downhill in the past few year , but the food at denny is ha gotten better .
this is the best denny is in the area . friendly , fast , good food . other denny is pale in comparison to this location .
got seated right away and the staff wa very pleasant . one of the cleaner denny is i have been to . i ordered a burger , fry , and a shake and all were really good and cooked just right.denny is ha always been one of my favorite casual dining restaurant , so this one is worth a visit when you are in the area .
i am sorry to give any star ... 15 minute for a cup of coffee , while waitress flitted around ... waited another 10 minute and after 25 minute of sitting there with the menu closed..i left . coffee and water untouched . waitress wa too busy telling the customer in the next booth about her daughter almost wedding . do not waste your time or money at this denny is . service is horrible and waitress are the worst ... food usually is not great..but i can not speak for this visit ... 25 minute and no one wanted to take my order . p ... king had a great breakfast that day ... service wa great ... only about 1.5 mile down the road .
i belong to this gym ... i live in the south section of pittsburgh , and i find that this gym is not too far from me . the staff is friendly , the equipment is quite good . you get two free personal training session when you join . they have lot of weight ( which my boyfriend us ) and a decent cardio room . the only thing i would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment . water is only $ 1 a bottle !
i bought a three month membership last year , mainly to attend the silver sneaker class . i wa in my early sixty and had not exercised in a while . i tried the evening class but they were very crowded and difficult , so i tried a morning class for senior . i like to stretch out before my class actually start , so i went to the tail end of a yoga class . the woman in this class were very nasty to me and told me that i wa not welcome to stretch out in their class . i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other member . i did not feel welcome here . i complained to the manager , who said that i wa welcome to stretch out in whatever class i wanted to , but the hostility of these yoga student wa very evident . do they think that this is their private gym ?
this is a gym , that part is true.but it is not well maintained . it is dingy and the locker room are abysmal , basically unusable . there is a pretty wide range of equipment , but not enough of it to really go around . if you are into free weight , that area is larger , but over crowded and very dungeony ( personally i go for that , just saying ) .the place must have a really conservative owner a well , because all the tv play fox news all day long . if you ask the staff for another channel , they will get around to changing it about half the time , the other half of the time you will be ignored and forced to watch a bunch of awful talking head tell you lie the entire time you are trying to run or lift . part of the problem is that the owner is cheap and not paying for cable where he can change the channel on the tv individually . they are linked to one box only.the place also let a whole ton of personal trainer basically do whatever they want . this mean that the area set aside for abdominal exercise , stretching , the rock climbing wall ( which i have never once seen turned on or used ) is over crowded with a punch of really out of shape people who are mostly carrying on conversation with their incredibly beefy personal trainer , because hey , the trainer is getting paid either way , if you want to waste your time chatting , they do not mind .
i really like this gym . it is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gym they do not have big contract and they have flexible membership . great selection of class . all the instructor are very good knowledgable and motivating . all the staff working there are super nice . their selection of the equipment is good too ! !
i spoke to a man this morning about the ice covered parking lot and sidewalk , a a business is liable to their customer if someone wa to slip and fall due to negligence on the business is part . he told me good luck and that i am liable to just be careful because everywhere is icy . after two year at this gym i am fed up with the way they treat their customer . he told me he wa fed up with me since i gave him a hard time about being out of towel a few week ago ( which they have had towel since then ) . they never clean the parking lot in the winter so make sure you wear boot outside and do not crash your car . aside from that , this gym is well just that a gym . my biggest critic ( aside from rude management and negligence ) would have to be that they do not encourage sanitization outside of the cardio room . there are not towel and spray around the weight machine , which i have never had an issue with , but i 'd hate to see that happen . i always make sure to at least wipe off my sweat mark from the machine , cause well that 'd be pretty nasty . it is pretty large in term of size and space to do anything aside from the ordinary weight and cardio . the worker well they are mostly young and do not really care too much ( the man who told me i wa wrong wa older and possibly a manager or owner ) . they tend to not keep on top of the wash with the towel even when it is not busy , which can be pretty annoying . their cardio room always ha fox news on two tv and then the middle tv ha sport center on regardless of what else is on tv . they recently have not even been putting pen game and stuff on . must be too busy watching the 52 inch screen they have in the lobby for the worker while the cardio room ha max 32 in the middle and 24 on the side probably . if i had to pay full price for my membership i probably would not belong here , but it is through my insurance . that said i do not swipe my card like most people in the front on my own . the machine is behind the counter . one guy always show me how to do it myself , which wa helpful the first time cause people are not always around the front desk . that said when he is standing behind there chatting i would expect him to do it since it is his job . this gym is nothing state of the art fancy fancy , but do you really need a fancy looking gym ? their cardio room is pretty massive and even at peak hour i have never had a problem getting a treadmill or elliptical . they actually even have two hellix trainer , which are not super common yet . sometimes when thing go out of order they take a while to fix them . i have run into the owner or manager one time in the bathroom when someone let a sink over floor and asked if i should tell the guy at the desk and she said oh no they are useless . this gym make a killing from a ) class b ) it is convenient and c ) their personal training is a separate company ( warrior fitness ) . i have been meaning to sign up for a trainer and i always see them busy . they all seem awesome and very helpful and challenging . not sure if they have a separate yelp page , but i would say from what i have seen they 'd bust your as for sure !
a a member for now 8 year i can honestly say , i have never had a negative experience at amerifit ! the owner and staff could not be more accommodating and strive for member satisfaction . the owner not only run the business but personally fix machine when needed , interacts with the member , and also personally salt and plow the parking lot when needed in the winter himself . there is another review on here stating the lot did not have any attention after which wa the largest ice storm we have had in year . i would like to state i wa sitting by the counter the day this lady came in upset and unnecessarily yelling at the front desk employee about the lot . the owner wa out there every couple hour doing the best he could to tame the condition of the lot . however on that day i believe everyone is car on the road turned into a snow sled including my own . if you truly felt in danger being on the road that day , you probably should of just stayed at home or a work.i love the fact the owner take pride in his business and is extremely hand on with the maintenance of the building . amerifit ha such a welcoming , no intimidation , home-like feel which is what i believe make this place so special and unique and ha kept my loyal membership for the last 8 year .
this is review rating may not be for everyone.amerifit is a gym where many serious body builder work out . this is an anti-planet fitness ( there are no pizza day ) . this place is where private personal trainer take on client who do not have an affiliation with planet fitness . you can pay $ 5 per day if you want to meet occasionally.what the casual person may see upon entering : you will hear lot of grunting and weight being dropped . do not be intimidated . the folk ( men and lady ) are doing this for competition ( usually ) .the place may seem run down ( older weight / machine ) . do not let this deceive you . the place may seem small . again - do not let this deceive you . they have smaller room / areas.they do have class upstairs that seem pretty intense ( not my cup of tea ) .why 4 stars:1 . i followed my trainer ( which mean i chose my trainer at a location where we could work out ) . my previous trainer were great but i did not necessarily like the gym ( too crowded or not enough room to work out ) .2 . equipment variety . example - cardio equipment . usually when you go into a gym , you will have a treadmill , a stepper , a recumbent bike , bike , elliptical ) - all one type . amerifit provides a variety of machine such a cybex . cybex is your traditional elliptical but you can control the elevation a well . they also have machine that will simulate ice skating3 . intensity - you do see people seriously working out . this can either motivate or intimidate you . it motivates me . i can also see folk doing exercise correctly.4 . the folk are nice . all the associate i have met are very nice.i apologize to the serious body builder for writing this review , but i think this is a very good secret to share . find you a trainer , meet him/her at amerifit , and workout . this is not a chain gym where everything is new with standard ( usually leased ) equipment .
i brought my husband and my parent all to papa j is last time my husband and i were in pittsburgh . my parent are really picky about their italian food , usually they drive place in east bumf* @ ( tarentum , ligonier ... ) to get their capital i-talian.my pop is kinda grumbly , and getting him to try something new is like pulling teeth . the only reason i got him here wa becuase they were on their way to drop u at the airport.well , my dad go back now regularly and that say a lot , considering he life in murrysville . the first good sign dad wa happy wa that he seemed impressed when it wa open- it wa noon a few day after christmas . second good sign wa that dad ordered wine , at it wa only 1 pm . dad , while not a teetotaler , rarely ha a drink before 5 pm so i know he wa anticipating a good meal . the kicker wa that he wa so happy he left our waitress a $ 20 tip on a $ 50 meal . can i say , i live in texas now and i still relive this afternoon back in december ? i had chicken picatta ... it wa perfect . my dad had eggplant rollatini , my mom had a pizza , and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara . it all wa amazing , delicous , and inexpensive . in austin , you can not get a decent italian meal , much le a decent italian meal for under $ 50 for four people.i know there are so many good italian place in pittsburgh but i just think back so fondly on this day ... when me dad liked someplace i took him : )
papa j is is by far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh , my hometown . i eat there almost every time i visit , and everything i have ever ordered ha been fantastic . fresh ingredient , simple preparation , reasonable price . also , they make the best pizza in town hand down .
this is one of my husband is fave restaurant in town . my husband generally order chicken parm , which is very good . their sauce is quite good . they serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum . i generally order one of their house salad ( think it ha a specific name , but can not recall off the top of my head ) which ha mixed green and i get it with blue cheese , pine nut and their yummy vinaigrette . a tad pricey for a salad that is just lettuce and cheese ( i want to say about $ 8 with the extra ) , but really good . ( especially with some cracked black peeper . ) i tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the green & bean . the place ha sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side . it ha a comfortable feeling . it also ha a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of place in the 'burgh . unfortunately , we have never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner !
thanks yelpers for this find . the service , the plating , the ambiance were wonderful . i had the eggplant parmigiana and it wa good - but different . it wa thinly sliced ( like deli meat ) and wa not breaded , it wa fried in a very light batter .
this place ha been a favorite for 20 year since we returned from a trip to italy having several week of fabulous fresh food , and could not think of any place we wanted to eat . papa j is measure up to our expectation with great salad , bead and wine . i am partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband like sampler , ravioli , fish , white pizza . i like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable server . sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby . but do not get the wrong impression -it is a great place-consistantly great food .
great , authentic , classic italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely place . i grew up eating here and make a visit nearly every time i come to town.try the fried calamari `` roman style '' for a little kick !
i have been to papa j is twice and had mixed experiences.both time i had the banana pepper appetizer , which is great and go really well with the fresh and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.for entree , me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience . i have had the fish sandwich ( very good ) and the eggplant parm sandwich ( okay ) . my girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it , but the basil wa over powering and the bread wa soggy with the dressing . the service is also a mixed bag . the first time our server went out of her way to take care of u and even made me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich . the second time , the server wa lackluster , did not know anything about the menu and wa not able to take proper care of u . i would return to papa j is , but i my terrible experience last time is not enough to say it would be my first pick of place to eat around carnegie/robinson .
i went there for dinner last night with a client . this is second time i visited . i had a scotch and he had a guiness . the ( -1 ) is for drink selection . just stock some better beer and higher end scotch and you are five stars.we started with the meatball covered with provolone and other blessed goodness . these did not disappoint . i had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic . it wa fantastic . they have so many good dish , but i wanted the pizza last night . i could not finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.i finished up with a coffee . the parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street , but it is a small town atmosphere in carnegie , pa . i love the downtown there .
what a wonderful surprise found in carnegie pa , just south of pittsburgh . i wa in town on business with a couple co-worker and after having a not so great meal the night before , we asked one of the local for a recomendation . they told u to try this little italian place called papa j is and boy did they send u to a great place.first off , when you walk up to the place , the front and side window give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside . you can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.i am not sure how long this place ha been around but the kitchen looked well used , while the dining area a well a the bar looked very clean and modern , almost a if it had been freshly updated . the server wa quick to welcome u and suggested several different item off the menu a his favorite when asked . the three of u were very hungry and wanting to try a few different thing , so we began with a margherita pizza which wa absolutely perfect . they obviously make their own bread and dough for the pizza and i do not think this pizza could have tasted any better . then came bowl of italian wedding soup which wa pretty good . of everything there , this wa the one item i probably could have done without . not that it wa bad , but there wa nothing particularly special about it . we also ordered the garlic roll ( not that the bread they already give you and the pizza wa not enough carbs for 1 meal ) and they were to die for . crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside , these thing were a meal by themselves . one of the guy with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce ( which is fresh made there , not out of some can ) and he wa right . a if these little killer bread ball with garlic were not good enough , dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better . by the time our meal came , we were all pretty full , but we pushed on and continued to eat . i had the veal parmigiano which wa tender and very good . it came with a side of pasta which i tasted just to try and it wa excelent a well . had i not been eating a week worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff , i certainly would have finished it . a it wa , i ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal . one of my co-worker had the chicken picatta which he said wa one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said wa very good a well . they had a great wine selection a well at reasonable price by the glass or bottle.overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere . i do not really know how expensive the area is for food , but coming from the chicagoland area , i fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable . the three of u ate very very well for an average of aproximately $ 30 each not including alcahol . fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price , who could ask for more.my only complaint is that i had to return to chicago and i am now craving to return to papa j is . i hope work sends me out here again sometime soon ! ! !
yay , i am a fan but sometimes service is a little slow , it wa very good for u this visit . go to papa j is every once in a while but mostly for the white pizza . it is the best white pizza i have ever had . order the white pizza on our visit this weekend ... it ha garlic , spinach , feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top . it wa delicious ! order fried calamari and it wa ok ... note to self next time try the calamari roman style.like the dinning room with the hardwood floor and bright lighting . the bar wa jumping thou never go to the bar .
terrible service . food unremarkable . waiter disappeared for 45 minute to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement . saved his tip by discounting meal after i complained . all and all , a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guest . not to be repeated , never again !
yay , i am a fan of the white pizza . had take out . the bar wa jumping when i picked up our order.the white pizza is so delicious ... with garlic , spinach , feta , and added some veggie . tried the roman style calamari , very good better than the fried calamari we had last time .
we met our good friend from morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu . i had read a few of the review ahead of time and the pizza wa mentioned more than once so by the time we got there , i wa jonesing for it . it certainly delivered . the crust wa great , the sauce wast too sweet and the topping were sufficient . our friend for the baby clam with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bit - a good a the pizza wa , this wa _much_ better . we will return again to this beautifully lit gem in carnegie pa soon !
ok , it friday night and have about 70 minute to eat . driving by papa j is and w say , let stop in and get a quick dinner . advice host that we are in a hurry . the host advised u it is a 90 minute service . the place wa crowded , we were seated at the last open table . however our waiter , jason , said he will do his best to get a out on time . we ordered our dinner immediately , with a salad and a glass of wine . in a few minute we had our wine , then in a few more second we had our salad and some great homemade italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving . for dipping . yum ! just a we were finishing our salad our dinner were delivered . great job jason ! the fettuccine carbanara wa very good ; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta . in and out in 60 minute . now that is some good service .
i have to say that i write this review with much regret , because i have always loved papa j is . but my recent experience there ha changed my mind a bit . from the minute we were seated , we were greeted by a server that wa clearly inexperienced and did not know the menu . a i said before , i have been to papa j is a good handful of time so i know the menu decently well , but the server could not explain any of the question i had about a couple new dish i wa thinking about trying . i swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minute ago.but it wa not just the knowledge of the menu . it wa one thing after another with our server . my wife asked for a glass of water 4 time until she finally got it ( at which point the meal wa over , so we did not care at that point ) . i mean come on , for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water ? there wa no one filling up water.my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meal . my dad and i both ordered the trout special ( trout with roasted red pepper and lump crabmeat ) . instead , the meal that wa delivered to both of u wa trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushroom . not what the special wa at all . and by the way , that item is on the menu a a regular item so whether or not the mistake wa made by the server ( which , we are sure it wa ) or the chef , who know for certain . not to mention , though , that a good server would not have served u that regardless . but before you think we had an unusal experience that wa all due to a poor server , let me continue . when we informed our server of the mistake , he did not really believe u until he checked his order sheet , and then he blamed the error on the chef . at this point , the meal had been sitting ( because it took u forever to flag this guy down again ) so the trout wa basically cold . the server then said he would have the meal re-made . so , he took the meal back to the kitchen . meanwhile , of course , my wife and mom are eating their meal and my dad and i are sitting there with no meal . also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for , and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda ( yes , believe that or not ) . all the kitchen did wa scrape their `` mistake '' off of our fish ! they did not remake anything . our fish wa served to u again with little piece of spinach and mushroom sticking all over it . quite frankly , the fish wa not good at all . i honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from mcdonald is that night . the server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we were not happy , but never offered anything such a dessert on the house . i am not looking for a handout , but our experience wa just plain awful that night . the guy never really even apologized for the mistake . normally , i may have asked for a manager , but at this point i wa ready to just get out of there ( plus , we had to be somewhere else that night ) .my opinion ... for the money , there are many other restaurant i would rather eat at .
this is a regular go-to for me . i love the food and the service . they always have the wine that i like and the food is always delicious . i suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store ( in the section where you can buy stuff to take home ) . it is sublime and make you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in it velvety loveliness .
i thought the interior were very nice . we stopped here on a friday night & i wa glad they were not busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing . my daughter & i split a chicken parm sandwich , which wa really good . instead of it being served on a hoagie , it wa served on thin bread- like focaccia or something . it wa pretty good- little messy.the dessert looked amazing . i thought it wa pretty cool how you can watch the cook prepare the food from outside . the kitchen is situated on a corner with lot of windows.i would return .
san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great . i am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area . i liked carnegie because u can stroll down main street and hit a couple place for lunch . i imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night . we ate a lunchtime and it wa nice .
coming here you get the feeling they have not changed much . the table , the decoration , the menu . all the same . doe that make you a little worried ? yes.i ordered the mushroom ravioli and it wa ... oily . very very oily . the actual ravioli wa okay , enough mushroom . but it wa oily . did i mention that ? ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired . i do not think i 'd have this place on my list of `` must '' for downtown . much better restaurant to visit !
had dinner at papa j is with a group of 6 . i loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large window . it felt like a neighborhood restaurant . on a saturday night , the restaurant wa full but not crowded . we were seated in a room with poor acoustic . it wa difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress . while she tried , i can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the special to both side of the table.people ordered bourbon on the rock before dinner which seemed watered down , while my lemon drop wa made nice . the bread wa delicious ! can you describe it to be creamy ? the fried zucchini wa lightly breaded and not too oily . it wa a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.we ordered a variety of dish . the pasta dish wa dry with more pasta than sauce or meat . those who ordered the fish special thought it wa delicious . the shrimp dish wa enjoyed a well . i had the chicken marsala which wa pretty good . the marsala sauce wa not too thick , and the chicken moist.hard to tell if the desert were `` homemade . '' the tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one . on the whole , i wa on the fence with my overall impression of papa j is . `` a-ok '' probably is the best way to describe it .
service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are `` just '' working . they have nice decor , nice bar and good bread . consider where this place is , the price are really really high . nothing is served on the side with main dish ... .
terrible service ... terrible food ... this place smell like rotten wet wood
great place for dinner , drink or a small celebration.papa j is is one of my favorite go to place for dinner when we do not have reservation and want a nice dinner out . my husband and i have eatten here upwards of 20 time over the last few year and have never been disappointed . i assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra table for dining on the other side of the resturant that the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy . i have been proved wrong . we are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minute . unfortunately , the alternate bar/lounge area is not always open . i really do not understand why more people do not go here . my favorite are the fried zucchini , wedding soup and pizza.the zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well . the wedding soup ha big chunk of carrot and celery . my husband also enjoys the pork entree especially the grilled pork and the pasta including the tomato cream sauce . also , their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite . make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table . also , if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event , consider papa j . they have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger party . we had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food .
papa j is is expensive and inconsistent . the ambiance is nice but it doe not justify the price . there are better restaurant in carnegie .
the boyfriend and i went about a year ago ( early 2012 ) after recommendation from my sister.i had the salad - it wa iceberg lettuce covered in essentially oil and salt . it wa so disgusting i could not eat it . and iceberg on an al la carte salad ? with nothing else ? ugh.we had an appetizer of the stuffed pepper . it wa not even a hot pepper , and the cold meatball flopped on top wa tasteless.for dinner i had the pesto . essentially noodle swimming in green liquid . not a ton of flavor there either.the boyfriend had the lemon chicken . his broccoli wa rock hard - like wood ! and the chicken wa very dry . we can make better food than wa served.after what we paid and what we got for it , i do not even care to try it again . all of the good review amaze me .
very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price . we had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriend . the waitress wa very efficient , but not very friendly . our order came out hot and excellently prepared ! try the tilapia milanese , it is excellent . best steamed broccoli iv'e ever had .
i wa pleasantly surprised by this restaurant . came here with no expectation . i wa greeted by a large open ( garage style ) window , that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street . it had modern furnishing and the staff were quite friendly.ordered the quattro formaggi pizza . quite good ! ! ! great balance of cheese . not too rich at all . crust wa excellent too . can not wait to come back .
just to start off , we were a party of 12 , which is always a little difficult . we were celebrating 2 birthdays.we loved the food , it wa delicious . my husband got a chicken parm sandwich , which is served on a yummy flat bread , and i got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it ) we all loved it ! it wa stunning . it wa made with a very delicious crust , nice and crisp , not soggy ( like pesto pizza can get ) the one waitress we had jasmine , wa fantastic ! she wa bright , friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu . she took extra time with the older lady in our group to help them with their selection ... now ... the other waitress.. mary something wa so incompetent ... she wa awful and rude . she missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they did not speak up ! ' ugh . then when it wa time to sing and cut the cake , my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing ? ' she came back , cut the cake ( all crazy with some huge piece and some super small piece like she never in her life cut a sheet cake ) and we did not even sing ! we were mad ! ! the place is so pretty , they have a new addition that wa just built within the last 2 year ( according to my father in law ) and it really nice . they look to have a cool bar area with some modern couch and a really sweet look . so good food , great looking place.. one bad waitress . price are about middle of the road for an authentic italian place , nothing crazy . all in all , we 'd like to go back again , but we want jasmine !
the menu ha lot of choice and the food is great ! the resturante ha been expanded so it is pretty large . the new section ha door that they leave open during nice weather which make for a nice ambience ! the bread is great and fresh baked daily !
i have been to this restaurant twice and wa disappointed both time . i will not go back . the first time we were there almost 3 hour . it took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place wa empty . when i complained the manager wa very rude and tried to blame u for taking to long to order . it made no sense , how could we order when the waitress wa not coming to the table ? after arguing with me he ended up taking $ 6 off of our $ 200+ bill . ridiculous . if it were up to me i would have never returned . unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight . again it took a long time to get our food . my food wa cold and bland , my kid food wa cold . my husband salmon wa burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claim it wa so disgusting . the wedding soup and bread were good , but that is it ! my drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when i asked . bad food , slow service and rude manager . i will pas on this place if my family decides to go again . not worth it at all with all the other good italian option around .
delicious ! everything i have ever had here wa great ! the white pizza is a must ! always amazing ! i am also a big fan of the chicken piccatta . the bread that they bring to the table is delicious too ! they have a wide variety of selection on the menu and they also have nightly special that always sound great ! their price are also reasonable . overall , i highly recommend this place !
2nd time a charm . this place wa 3.5 start the first time i came , but stepped up large tonight . waitress wa righteous and very fun . food wa all excellent . caesar salad tasty -- got with tomato big $ on that , fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor . can not wait for the leftover ! ! the white pizza is that star though . the crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf . i do not throw those accolade out easily , especially on pie , but this joint serf it up . good vibe , great service , phenomenal food . ill be back .
service wa great . apps delish , specifically the stuffed banana pepper & lentil with ham soup . i think i chose the wrong entree though because i ordered a cod with crabmeat special . the cod wa completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top . it all reminded me of boiled fish . yuck ! note to self . order the pasta !
i love this place ! the food is always so fresh and delicious . the staff is always friendly , a well .
spinach/feta cheese salad : b-pesto alfredo penne : : a+coconut cake huge piece : a+bread small portion : bservice b host seemed grumpy , waitress good , but then she got busy .price : pasta wa $ 15 and the portion smallish more like a $ 12.99 dish arrive early on saturday night this place packed after 6pm
it wa just what we were looking for . the service wa great . my husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size . it wa great ( spicy ) and enough for a meal . i had the stuffed eggplant . that wa very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier . i would definitely go back . really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back .
we stopped at papa j is last friday night ( 8/1 ) for a round of drink . there were 7 of u altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening . one member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couch along the wall , a it wa fairly busy that night . in the short time that he wa there , a man who wa behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else . he then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if we could have a server take our drink order . she said `` yep '' and then abruptly turned and walked away . at that point , he asked to see the manager who came a few minute later . when my friend told him of what had occurred , the manager said `` what do you want me to do '' ? my friend said `` an apology would be a good start '' whereupon the manager looked back at him and said `` get out and do not come back '' ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? are you kidding ? ? ? ? my friend is well traveled and frequently stay at higher end hotel and dines at quality restaurant . he wa not screaming or belligerent in any way , shape , or form ; simply informing the manager of what had occurred . that being said , we left and went back to 131 east , where we had previously eaten . the service there wa fabulous , a wa the meal and the drink creative and exquisite.there are new restaurant that have opened in carnegie a of late . papa j is is no longer the only game in town . obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management . appalling ! ! do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurant that are within walking distance of papa j is . they understand the concept of customer service .
some of the best chow around -- love this place . the bread and salad and soup are great .
finally , great tuscan-style italian food in pittsburgh , not that tasteless stuff that local think is italian.the bread wa warm and fresh . the bolognese sauce wa creamy and rich , and unlike most restaurant wa made with veal . i love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.i am looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken option , and next time , i am saving room for dessert ! the display of cake and pastry at the door wa amazing .
man ha this place gone down hill . my husband and i went a couple of week ago . we had salad and pasta . both were on the verge of inedible . with a single glass of wine , i felt downright robbed at the $ 50 price tag . seriously , i could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home . classico is better . and the service wa pretty absent to make it even worse ... seemed she knew it wa terrible and did not want to deal with it . seriously , i 'd rather eat at the og .
food wa not good at all ! my husband & i ate here a couple week ago for the first time . i ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta . the salad wa just a huge plate of spring mix ( nothing else in it ) with way to much vinegar dressing . my lettuce wa drowning in the vinegar . my pesto pasta had no flavor ( did not taste like a cream sauce to me ) & the pesto wa so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodle . my husband is pasta had even le flavor than mine . we ate about a quarter of the food & could not even finish it . we took it home & it wa so bad i did not even eat my leftover . and i hate wasting food ! ! plus the price are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality . do not waste your time eating here . there are much better italian restaurant in pittsburgh .
once upon a time , papa j is wa a great place to eat . great food and knowledgeable wait staff.unfortunately , after a couple of very unsatisfactory meal we will not be going back . looking for a great italian meal ? look elsewhere .
well , papa j is ha officially priced itself out of our budget . we ordered 2 salad with gorgonzola and pine nut and the total wa $ 35.98 ! ! ! $ 18 per salad ? ? ! ? ! ? really ? ! i wa stunned when i saw the bill ! it is lettuce , cheese , and pine nut ! $ 18 / salad ? ! totally crazy !
our pizza wa cold and our drink where empty . we are not going back . ! the waitress started a attentive , but slowly slipped away to the point where thing became frustrating .
talk about overpriced . $ 18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it . the latter wa terrible , thin and flabby and rather unappealing . the pasta itself wa ok , a wa the sauce . the dessert are pretty good . but honestly , that is a $ 10 dish whose price ha been inflated .
wonderful food . some item a little over priced . but never disappointed.i have friend that love the white pizza . i have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.i love their fresh salad . huge . the house dressing is perfect every time . we have been there many time and it just doe not get old.we always have the bean and green . the meatball appetizer is superb . by-pass the chicken parm , it is the only thing we have ever found lacking ... .it is just really plain . the alfredo is excellent.we , almost never go anywhere else in carnegie because we like this place so much .
i struggle to write this review simply because this dining experience confused me . first , the restaurant itself is on a convenient corner st in downtown carnegie is main street . when you walk in you the first thing you see is a counter filled with dessert and amazing looking house made bread . it rather look like a deli counter . you have to walk around to get to the hostess station and then can go left to the bar or right to the dining area . a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done . the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant . it felt much more upscale once in the dining area , but i did find the overall restaurant tastefully unique . the food - a wide range of italian dish and seafood . we ordered the crab hozel a an appetizer . it wa an average serving of lump crab meat , i had to ask for cocktail sauce . it wa tasty , but cost u $ 18 . we then ordered the veal and shrimp entree with sauteed veggie like artichoke , eggplant , pepper , etc . there were 4 smaller sized cutlet of veal and 3 shrimp . $ 28 . there wa no salad or pasta side offered . the dish wa prepared properly and wa ok. we just felt it needed something else . now the bread that wa offered to our table came in a small basket and wa filled with a variety of their house made bread . the pepperoni bread wa amazing ! i mean really delish . this alone i would have given 5 star . the service - our server wa ... well ... .i am not sure what he wa quite frankly . annoying ? confused ? hyper ? he appeared to have no idea what he wa doing half the time . bouncing around the table , asking the same question over and over , forgetful , spastic , etc . at one point one of my colleague said , `` is he on crack ? '' we chuckled , but seriously ! he forgot to even ask u if we wanted dessert , which wa too bad because we saw some amazing looking offering in the case a we were leaving.overall - if i were in the area again i would definitely stop in to get some pepperoni bread to go , a they do sell it by the loaf . however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
many trip to pittsburgh over 20 year . first time here . had the gnocchi special . one of the best gnocchi i have ever had . pizza wa excellent . service wa great !
did dinner with my gf last saturday at papa j is prior to going to the off the wall theater . this wa the first time we have been to this restaurant . we usually stop a riley is pour house across the street for a bite before seeing a show in this town but today we decided to shake it up and do something different.the place is deceptively larger than it look from the outside . it wa also busier than we would have expected on this particular evening and we got one of the remaining table which wa located near the entrance and the bar . the traffic from both the customer and the staff that flowed past u wa a little noisy and distracting and we could tell that is why it wa one of the last table available . but our waitress came by promptly , got u drink ( i had a hoegaarden and my girl ordered an absolute water and cranberry ) , gave u menu and recited the special of the day.after viewing the menu for a bit , i decided on the veal parmigiano ; my date went with one of the special , a chicken and broccoli gnocchi dish . the plate took about 15 minute to arrive and the portion were humongous ... enough for a filling lunch the next day . my veal wa tender and delicious but it is really the gnocchi that left the biggest impression . you could tell that it wa house made ; it wa like little fluffy pillow dissolving in your mouth with each bite . i never tasted gnocchi like it before.over all i give papa j is a big thumb up . the food wa good , most of the dinning area is seemed cozy , the building itself ha a certain charm with it high ceiling and the table draped in white table cloth give it a pristine appearance . although i thought it wa a bit pricy , i did not feel a if i have been taken . other than the location of our table , it wa the pre-theater perfect meal . i only hope get a more intimate table next time we stop for dinner .
a unique and great find in downtown carnegie . my fiance and i came here for a weekend lunch and wanted something different from our usual weekend spot . we had the sausage stuffed pepperoncini is a an appetizer ( these are never my favorite and were just ok , but the marinara served with them wa very tasty , a wa their homemade bread ) , i had a really great wood fired meatball/ ricotta pizza and fiance had the chicken parm sandwich . our waiter wa very attentive and friendly . i ordered a cannoli on the way out the door and it wa fantastic . not overly sweet , crunchy-chocolate dipped shell stuffed with thick cream and mini chocolate chip . amazing . we will definitely be back here !
we came to carnegie to check out the black lamb consignment shop . lucky for u that we also discovered papa j is -- we loved it ! the fried calamari appetizer wa excellent , a wa the fettuccine carbonara . we will be headed back to this place a often a we can for a real italian dining experience .
ok a few thing . first we walked in and asked for a table and wa told it would be 5 min . so after 10 min , we were seated and there wa 10 table that were open ! why the hell wa there a wait ? ? ? the older man that took u to the table could have done nicer . the bread wa great and that wa about it . the food wa not bad but it wa not good .
i wrote a letter to the papa j is , but did not receive a reply therefore i will share my experience online.tonight a friend and i dined at your location . we were seated in the bar area by the sidewalk , which is what we requested because of the great weather and the happy hour special . our server took our order of a gingerale , fried zucchini appetizer , side salad , wedding soup , eggplant rolotini and chicken piccata ( correct spelling ) .we thoroughly enjoyed the bread & wedding soup.the side salad wa rather bland and unexciting , lacking flavor & texture . the spring salad consisted of leaf lettuce , a single slice of tomato and one black olive . i would have expected some addition such a onion , pepper , cheese , cucumber , crouton , carrot and the like . we enjoyed the fresh air while waiting for our appetizer , but were growing concerned that it would arrive too close to the meal , so we asked the server ( bartender ) about the appetizer and he told u that he had forgot to `` put it in '' . he offered to put it in at this point , but advised u that our meal would be out soon . we decided to just wait for our meal and forgo the appetizer which were looking forward to . the main dish were acceptable , not outstanding . the eggplant wa very tasty and well prepared . the chicken piccata wa flavorful , but not a expected.the chicken seemed to have been steamed or baked . it had no sign of being coated and sautéed to a rich golden brown . the chicken wa just pale white.the sauce wa a simple lemon flavor , it lacked any depth that would have resulted from the browning of the chicken . i tasted no garlic or shallot . the sauce lacked that famous tang usually supplied by caper , which were absent . no pasta wa served with the chicken . the side of vegetable were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor . the would have benefited from a roasting which would have produced a rich savory taste produced by extraction of the natural sugar . once our meal were finished our plate were taken and we waited another 20 minute for the check . the server seemed more concerned with what wa on television rather than his customer . the total wa $ 43 and change.i would have expected the salad and soup would have been removed from the bill for the error of not putting in our appetizer order , but no such offer wa made and i saw no manager come around and check on the customer , a is customary.i am hesitant to go back to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone after tonight dining experience . i hope this feedback will be beneficial to your business .
this is it . my favorite in the pittsburgh area . i moved out of the area for 10 year and this wa the first meal i had back . there wa a table of italian speaking italian behind me - how much more authentic can you get ? ! ? i bring all of my out of town guest here and not one had been left disappointed . my recommendation are to order the mozzarella carozza ( or however it is spelled ) and then one of the special . if you are not into a special , you will be fine - order off the menu . but the special are typically amazing . when my better half wa living 4 hour away , he drove into town and i made him get back in he car to go here . instead if complaining , he asked if we could take his parent next time .
i gave them 4 star for two reason - 1 ) they do not have fresh pasta and 2 ) my boyfriend is chicken abruzzo wa dry . the service wa attentive and the bread wa amazing . my carbonara wa incredible ! the main dining room wa a nice grotto style reminiscent of rome ; nice for couple and girlfriend catching up on life . i loved the montpluciano in a carafe , but do not miss the extensive italian wine list . we will definitely return to this carnegie gem !
yummy yum , let me get me some . this place rock ! ! ! went here with the wife and had a great dinner . portion are very generous and the food is delicious . be prepared to pay top dollar though for the entree , but they are worth every penny !
great restaurant . had the eggplant parmesan and it wa very good . bradley wa our server and he wa on top of thing all the time . price are reasonable and the decor is inviting . can not wait to go back .
we recently decided to celebrate our anniversary at papa j is . there is a parking lot in the back of the building and the entrance is on the side . the food wa perfectly prepared , served at the proper temperature , and wa quite delicious . portion size were quite satisfying . the complimentary bread and oil wa excellent . the service wa polite and efficient .
had dinner with a friend . my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage . the waitress wa extremely rude . he never did get the correct meal . when we talked to the manager , his answer wa . , '' well what do you want me to do fire the waitress ? '' too many good restaurant in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
i stopped by here a couple of friday ago with my wife and 3 other couple . another couple in our party had made reservation before hand and when we arrived a couple of minute after that time , we were immediately taken to our table . whenever you first walk into papa j you immediately head past both their dessert case and bread making area . that is pure genius on their part a both their dessert and bread look good ! then to get to our table we also walked past a bar and up a flight of stair . after that i did not really see much else of the restaurant.after our whole party had arrived and our waitress had taken all of our drink order she came back up to our table and promised u that she would be back shortly a she had some dessert to take to a table . after about 15 minute or so she finally did make it back to our table . for my dinner entree i decided on having the romano chicken . it came out a short time later with a side of broccoli . the chicken had a nice golden color to it breading and tasted pretty good although a bit salty . i can take at least some credit for that though a i may have used the parmesan that wa on the table quite liberally . meanwhile the broccoli wa over cooked for my taste and seemed mushy whenever i bit into it.the bottom line for me is that i might stop by here again in the future . i would not be the person to recommend it but i also would not turn it down . i feel like the price were fair for what you got and only wish that the service wa a little better .
one of my favorite place in pittsburgh ! reasonable price & delicious food . only one weird quirk - they do not bring the delicious fresh bread until you order - but it is complementary ( sometimes they will if you ask nicely , but it doe not come automatically ) . everything is super fresh - my friend & i always order a salad or two a a starter ( they are huge & do not offer side portion ) - i strongly recommend the panzanella salad . then , any of the pasta . seriously , they are all good ! if you remember to save room for dessert - the cake are all giant ! definitely enough to share ( probably with a large table ) .
we visited on 11/15 with a party of 15 . while i know a party of 15 can be overwhelming , we did call in advance for reservation . thus , allowing proper staffing . we arrived early and headed to the bar . the bartender there greeted u quickly and took great care of u . when it wa time for our reservation we were seated immediately . that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst . we sat for 20 minute before a server came to our table . at that point , she said i will grab you water and bread . another 10 minute go by and member of our party went to the bar to grab drink a the server vanished ( still no water or bread ) . she finally come back to the table with bread ( no water ) and take our drink order ( about 40 min into sitting at the table ) . next thing we know , a nice gentleman by the name of patrick is our new server . he really stepped up the service and should be commended . however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana pepper which arrived cold . we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which wa incredibly cold . while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience wa fairly terrible.not once did the front of house manager come check on u . this is the second time i have visited and the 2nd time i have been disappointed.also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
i never write review but my new year is eve wa ruined due to how awful my experience wa . the food wa subpar but it wa a lost cause by the time we got it . for $ 50 a person it wa terrible . the menu wa a small , select menu . i got the shrimp and veal and my veal wa dry . but a for the real issue ... .last night for nye we went for dinner with the intention of going out to celebrate after . we had reservation for 7pm made week in advance . we did not get our food until around 930 and did not get our check for another hour . we were there for an hour and a half before we even got bread . everything we asked for wa `` i will get it to you in a little bit . '' i ordered a drink 3 time and never got it . i do not understand because it wa not busy at all and they only had a select menu . you 'd think they 'd have a handle on thing . how do not you have salad ready and made in a cooler or bread basket prepared when reservation were made week ago ? anyway , we all ended up missing our reservation at other event we had planned for after dinner . i will probably never go back again .
a large group of u have enjoyed an excellent dinner for the past three year and each year it get better and better . we order entree from all area of the menu . the bread and antipasto are exceptional . attentive and friendly staff with strong knowledge of the menu .
my husband and i dinned at papa j is last evening with another couple . we came equipped with up to $ 14.00 off coupon we had planned to use , and they planned on using their entertainment book coupon . we were told , rather harshly and rudely that we could only use one coupon per table ... hard and fast rule of the establishment . but we protested , there are 2 couple here , paying on separate check , so can not understand this rule . said they would take up to 3 entertainment book coupon per table , but not the one that drew u in from online clipper magazine . what difference doe it make which coupon you use ? ? ? ? if you allow one , why not the other ! not building a `` come back '' attitude for u customer , and we do not intend to go back . some food wa really good , while other meal were just ok , esp . in portion size . all menu item are ala carte , so pretty pricey , so coupon discount would have been nice . waiter we had , though he said he had been there for 21yrs , wa pretty abrasive and a little neglectful with his service .
worst service of all time . 2 hour for a pizza and had to repeat ourselves to the waiter 5 time throughout the night . then asked for the bill and wa given a bill 3 time the amount ours should have been with a bunch of item that should not be on there . place is a total joke .
what a class act ! feel like a restaurant right in italy . beautiful linen draped , candlelit table with a selection of dining area . extensive menu . wonderful wedding soup , obviously house made . every entree in our group wa superb . chicken and pork dish wonderful . pasta cooked properly and great sauce . wait staff were neatly well dressed and extremely cordial . this restaurant is a must ! had a great pecan ball and luscious yellow cake for dessert .
5 star . it is that good . freshly made , and you can taste that it is . the pasta alfredo wa made to order . it wa so delicious , i think they used the pasta water to make the sauce , incredible . reasonbly priced . clean atmosphere . knowledgable server , thank you patrick . we had a great dining experience .
always a treat to have dinner at papa j is ! been going there for year and the quality is always the best . always proud to take new peep to savor the menu delight ! michael from mt . lebanon .
thought it wa awesome ... first time i have been there and with most of the family ... 16 of u ... they accommodated u well ... the sever wa very knowledgeable and wa fast ... a expected since such a big party ... food wa great although i over stuffed with appetizer , bread & oil , and beverage ... not your average italian restaurant
superb service and food . parking can be a little tough and this place is a bit pricey . if you can get in and are okay paying a little more you will not be disappointed .
we went here tonight and i am torn on how to review this establishment . i have not been here in year and now i remember why . we picked the calamari pepper topped for an appetizer and it wa fabulous . it better have been at $ 13 . they had numerous special and the female picked the gnocchi entree which were fantastic but at a price tag of $ 25 per , which we only discovered at bill time . shame on u for not asking the price and no wonder the server wa pushing those dish . i had the chicken parm and it wa a nice portion for $ 15 . the cappuccino cheesecake wa good but small at $ 6 . the place wa packed and drink were sparse but the glass were way too small.overall an expensive but enjoyable evening . if picking a special , do yourself a favor and ask the price .
fantastic gem in pittsburgh . we were up in pittsburgh for a family function and looking for a great italian joint for dinner , we reviewed yelp and discovered papa j is , we could not be happier ! the food wa spot on , and there wa absolutely nothing wrong with the meal . if your looking for authentic italian , do not miss this place .
love this place especially the garden salad with feta and pine nut . when i am working close to carnegie , i schedule my day around lunch here . the homemade bread are amazing too . great atmosphere and service make this one of my favorite close to downtown pittsburgh .
the last visit i overlooked the $ 25 gnocchi special . the reason it bothered me wa they tell you the special but not the price . okay , shame on u for not asking.my daughter wanted to try here again for her birthday . so i have decided i 'd go against my not go there anymore and appease her.we have been here 30 minute and just got our water . our appetizer ha yet to come out . the bread is apparently just a scarce . hey but we have a full cup of fresh parm cheese . i ordered the chicken marsala and i wa informed there is an up charge for pasta with my meal . really ? potato or pasta are always included with marsala . hooray the appetizer finally come out and half as warm and horribly bland . we asked for a manager and the waitress overheard u and asked u is there an issue . ma'am please just leave u alone a we will speak to the manager . 5 minute and cricket , yep you guessed it , no manager to our table . and to boot the waitress stood there staring at u which is why the ma'am please leave u alone . it wa like she wa a demon possessed . before i imploded , we had to walk out . never ever again will we return here . time to find somewhere else to enjoy my daughter birthday .
the food wa ok no complaint it is sitting at the bar and watching the male bartender stand around doing literally nothing while the woman bartender bust her as made it a uncomfortable night especially knowing that they will pull tip not returning again and shame on the two manager for not notice it
i wanted to love this place . we started off with a caesar salad , we asked is the dressing homemade we were told yes however i have had a number of homemade caesar and this wa deff not . they also topped it off with one crouton ? my meal wa the chicken breast with bone in and broccoli . chicken came out literally the size of chicken nugget and my broccoli wa basically raw and cold . i have three star because the bread wa actually really good and my finance meal wa also mediocre . he had the eggplant rolitini and in my opinion it had a weird flavor . we would go back to try the pizza but i would not suggest wasting 50 buck on this meal .
literally just walked out after waiting at our table for 15 minute with no server in site . we were never even offered drink . it wa embarrassing ! others came in after u an were serf . not u . your food may be good , but the service is deplorable ! just so rude .
this place is wonderful . my husband and i had our first date here so that is why we chose this place for our rehearsal dinner . the food is phenomenal . they were so accommodating for the guest we had that had allergy . they recommended various way for u to save money like bringing our own wine and dessert . they were incredibly attentive and everything wa just perfect . i can not say enough good thing ! every time we come here the food is wonderful and the staff polite and helpful . we will definitely continue to keep coming back here for year to come !
i am up in the air about how i feel regarding emmert dental . being that it is located in market square can be both a good or bad thing . parking is scarce not to mention you have to pay for it yet you have great restaurant and coffee place around you . the office itself is old and raggedy looking but the staff are young and hip . i think possibly a little too young and hip . my dentist knew what she wa doing but i did not adore her . i am still working out my bill because they charged me too much on my copay and do not really seem to have all their info . together . after a cleaning and filling , i think i am going to look for somewhere else to get my future dental work done ...
i have decided where i stand with emmert dental . they are unprofessional , rude and have no clue what they are doing ( behind the desk ) . i will not be going back nor will i have nice thing to say about them .
the worst dental experience of my life . they are butcher ! my husband and i went to emmert dental in bethel park for a routine cleaning and check up . i had one tooth that i had a recent root canal on and a few small cavity that needed filled . after the so called dentist - dr carnavali - did my exam , i needed 3 additional root canal and an extraction ! an extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal . i wa told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown wa no longer possible . i did not know any better , so i agreed to schedule the extraction for a few week later . the `` dentist '' wanted to extract it that day , but i had plan for the weekend and wa not about to be in pain . so , 2 week later , i went in for the extraction . after they gave me novocaine they get me with `` you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth '' . i have never had any issue with bone loss with previous extraction so i did not feel it wa necessary . i had 3 employee surrounding me , pressuring me for this bone graft . so , i reluctantly agreed . i had to pay $ 259.00 for this `` bone graft '' . so , i signed everything . i wa not even given enough time to read the document , so i should have known and got up and left right then and there . the `` dentist '' started the extraction . i have never been so uncomfortable in my life . he pulled on my tooth , used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and wa pulling so hard that my head wa coming up and slamming back down against the head rest . finally , after a good 15 minute of this torture , he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw . i wa literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat . he then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area . i am assuming this wa the bone graft . i ended up with many stitch . i wa given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following saturday so they could start the bridge . then i wa hit with a bill of $ 569.00 ! my insurance cover 100 % of extraction . i wa in so much pain for 2 week following the extraction . pain severe enough that i had to call off work and i could not sleep at night . i refused to go back to emmert dental . and after a visit to a very reputable dentist , an endodontist and an oral surgeon , i have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage emmert dental ha done to my mouth . they caused a very large deformity in my jaw and i am at risk to lose additional teeth . save yourself a lot of time , money and pain . emmert dental only care about the money , will over charge you and leave you le than happy with the dental work . they are butcher and should not even call themselves dentist . and if you have an issue with their billing practice , do not expect to that resolved easily . i have called numerous time and i am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in . i have contacted the bbb and a lawyer . i expect and want a full refund . no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru . they do unnecessary extraction so they can do a more expensive procedure such a a bridge or an implant . now i have to go thru oral surgery , more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of emmert dental . and the root canal they said i needed , my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that i do not need tooth canal . in fact , the teeth are perfectly healthy . they are crook and butcher .
the worst dental office i ever been . no one can beat it ! ! ! you should avoid it at any time .
despite the low rating here on yelp , i do not feel this dental office is all that bad . the office look new or renovated , clean and organized . emmert dental ha three location : settler is ridge , market square and bethel park . i am usually a patient of the market square location of emmert dental and so far , i prefer the settler is ridge location . i came here for an emergency appointment and this wa the only office that could squeeze me in . i arrived 15 minute early and they called me back exactly at my appointment time . the assistant wa so friendly and made me feel comfortable at all time . the doctor wa also friendly and made a great effort to make sure i left satisfied . i wa in and out in a matter of minute and the service wa great .
i went here to have my teeth cleaned and they told me they found a cavity . since i have never had a cavity in my life , i asked the dentist to show it to me on the x-ray and he said he wa not able to . i did not feel comfortable with his diagnosis so i went to another dentist ( whose office is not a chain like emmert ) and that dentist did not find a cavity . this wa three year ago and my teeth are fine , still no cavity . i do not believe in going to a dental chain and i do not recommend anyone else go either . i have read horrible article about their pushy sale tactic and performing un-needed procedure which is what i would have experienced at emmert had i not been smart enough to find a second opinion . there are better , independent dentist in the area and i recommend people to go to them .
would not have my dog teeth cleaned here ! this place is one of the worst dental office i have ever walked into . enough said
i have never posted a yelp review before . this meal wa so horrible that i downloaded the yelp app just so i could warn others to stay away ! we ordered food from capri since we were going to voodoo brewery . we ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones . we ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an italian wedgie , which wa just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onion . no sign of italian meat to be found . no marinara sauce . it wa inedible . we ended up walking to kfc instead . i want to leave a zero star rating , but yelp will not let me . so they get an undeserved star .
i judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni . while grabbing a brew at voodoo , my friend and i were feeling a bit hungry . thankfully a menu wa available and capri pizza wa just across the street . we ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up . i wa pleasantly surprised ! the cheese wa not greasy , the sauce wa flavorful , and the dough wa chewy yet crunchy ... what more could you ask for ? we were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from capri.next time we will try the pepperoni and post an update . i see yummy pizza in our future . if you are grabbing a pint a voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly , order something cheesy at capri pizza in homestead .
i never even made it inside ! after pulling into the parking lot and getting out of my car i wa `` greeted '' by a huge bouncer who wanted to search me . if a pizza place need a bouncer then it is not the kind of place i want to eat at . must draw a dangerous crowd or something .
a vehicle with the door , truck opened , music playing , backed up to the front door wa my first indication that i wa is in the wrong place . the bouncer wa pleasant , however he wanted to search me prior to entering . i said no and turned around and left . you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
eat at your own risk . the service is terrible , the staff seem to be generally clueless , the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistake , and there is no sense of fast in their fast food . when we came , half of the menu board wa still on breakfast , and it wa 4:30p . the only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and taste just like mcdonald is should . then again , the franchise is owned by rice , and i have come to take terrible service is their mo .
my expectation for mcdonalds are t rarely high . but for one to still fail so spectacularly ... that take something special ! the cashier took my friend is order , then promptly ignored me . i had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person behind me . i waited over five minute for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid is meal . after watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food , i asked where mine wa . the manager started yelling at the cashier for `` serving off their order '' when they did not have their food . but neither cashier wa anywhere near those control , and the manager wa the one serving food to customer and clearing the boards.the manager wa rude when giving me my order . she did not make sure that i had everything on my receipt , and never even had the decency to apologize that i felt i wa getting poor service.i have eaten at various mcdonalds restaurant for over 30 year . i have worked at more than one location . i expect bad day , bad mood , and the occasional mistake . but i have yet to have a decent experience at this store . it will remain a place i avoid unless someone in my party need to avoid illness from low blood sugar . perhaps i should go back to the racially biased service of steak n shake instead !
this mcdonald is is so bad it is amazing . order : big mac , large fry , diet coke.the soda machine wa broken . no sodas.then i got to the window . `` we rang you up for medium fry . '' ( not what i asked for ) `` well , if you want a large , you are gon na have to wait 4 minute . we just started a new batch . `` left with : big mac , medium fry , no coke.actually , now that i think about it , this wa one of my better experience there ...
i should be able to give this mcdonalds 0 star . if they had an award for worst mcdonalds in and around pittsburgh this would take the cake . it blow my mind too . being in the waterfront a manager could make this place shine but there is no polishing a turd . p*ss poor service , a filthy dining room , filthy bathroom , attitude by the worker ... if i had to give a real world example of what `` misery love company meant '' , i would take you here and make you order food and sit down and eat . if mcdonalds depended on this one to do good they would of went out of business year ago . i have gon na here a dozen time and 11 and a half time had the worst experience and the worst food i ever had from a mcdonalds . i am sorry to be this harsh but you know what , no i am not sorry . this mcdonalds ruined some of my best day and everyone need to know to stay away . i 'd rather a second chik fil a at the waterfront than this place . stay away . far far far far away . do not even look at this place , cover the side of your face and just keep driving . there is nothing to see here .
looooong wait , always screw up my order . poor customer service . wa going to hire me but said i had to go somewhere else to do my orientation .
service wa a bit slow but the food wa just what you would expect from mcdonalds ! everyone wa very friendly and the bathroom wa clean ... which made my 5 year old very happy !
best mcdonald is i have been to ! everyone is so sweet and friendly ! the drive through line wa long but i got theough super fast . there were even napkin in the bag ( which never even happens . ) it wasnt always that good , i used to go to wendy is to avoid the rude worker . but , it is great now !
this mcdonald is ha never been that great , but last night they reached an all time low . i ordered a big mac and large fry . it wa obvious that the fry were old and they refried them to heat them up . the bun of the big mac wa so stale , it wa almost rock hard and most of the lettuce wa turning brown . i have officially given up on going here . i will drive the extra distance to go to the one in oakland from now on .
worst mcdonalds i have ever been to . last time i went chicken nugget were under cooked . people were getting refund wait time wa so long . my daughter asked for gogurt w happy meal got apple had to wait 10 min to change to gogurt . soda is watered down and gross . rude staff doesnt know what they are doing . will never go back even though it the closest one to me .
i have been to a lot of mcdonald is in my time , this is the worst . service wa unbelievably slow , only frown all around and not very clean . just skip this one and you will be better off .
this is a tiny starbucks and it location like this ( although cute ) make you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave . leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with bench and it is a central part of the waterfront shopping . starbuck is not my favorite coffee chain by any mean . is it just me or do all starbuck coffee taste a little burnt and bitter ? no matter how trendy , cool and upscale their establishment are i can not get around the yicky tasting bitterness of staryucks regular coffee . talk about over roasting a bean ... maybe something ha changed with their regular coffee but i have not drank it in about a year . i am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff . still i will give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doe not taste half a bad a the regular coffee bean .
friendly staff , same starbucks fair you get anywhere else . sometimes the line can get long .
mmm ... peppermint mochain my quest to visit every starbucks in the usa i have stopped at yet another location . this one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area .
typical starbucks coffee chain . 2 thing i dont like about this starbucks : 1 . ive been there twice and both time the place ha been dirty , compared to the other starbucks i have been in.2 . if you have to use the bathroom , they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle . im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.aside from that , good coffee and fast/friendly service .
if there wa ever a `` get your coffee and go '' starbucks , this is it . right in the center of the waterfront , this starbucks ha no sofa , comfy chair , only table seating . i love the baristas here , but i do not like the location of the building .
this is a typical starbucks . the coffee is good but the store is suprisingly dirty .
i have to agree with joe on this one . the baristas are extremely friendly , and the service is great , but the fact that there are no comfy chair or couch is very unwelcoming . i do think however that the building is beautifully an strategically located in the center of the shopping . i just wish they had better seating .
i just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish . well , in my world recently because it is been a while since i have been here.they have added more seating which make it way more conducive to having a meeting here . which is my concern during the week . i imagine during the weekend it just fill up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater . the coffee , or tea for me.. is still same old same old . i do not imagine one single starbucks will break the mold and make original drink ...
great location ! close to shop and theatre . nice staff .
regarding quality of beverage , this is just your average starbucks . i can not complain but am not blown away either . however , i really like the location of this shop , which is located in the center of the waterfront is specialty retail shop . though in the midst of a lot of retail , the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass , flower , and a fountain . hanging out here is very relaxing .
i love the location of this starbucks , which is why i am giving it 4 star . it is right smack in the middle of clothing store , the loews movie theater , a well a restaurant . i love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a saturday while perusing various store such a the gap or loft . i also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt.while the drink are the same a you would find at any starbucks , the baristas and staff are really friendly , perhaps more so than other area starbucks . my drink or choice when i come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti ( or trenta ... ) berry hibiscus refresher . yum ! it is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up that leaf me feeling refreshed and hydrated .
this starbucks is teeny-tiny ! seating inside is very limited . this is a starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the waterfront.baristas are friendly and fast .
a far a starbucks go , this is a pretty nice one . the baristas are friendly and while i wa here , a lot of regular must have come in , because they bantered away with almost everyone . the bathroom wa clean and well maintained and the trash wa not overflowing in the canister around the store . the pastry looked fresh , but i did not partake . the noise level wa also at a nice working level - not too loud , music just barely audible.i do wish there wa more seating . it is nice that this location ha a counter at the end of the bar for sole worker , but it doe not replace more table . i am sure this is not a much of a problem in the summer when there is the space outside.there wa a treat receipt promo going on , but the barista did not tell me about it , which i found odd . usually when they have promos like that going on , they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is . today it wa one of their new pastry for $ 1 , i know in the summer they do $ 2 grande iced drink with that morning is receipt.overall , nice working or socializing environment . very friendly and inviting . it is what i have come to expect from starbucks , so point for consistency .
i am not a huge fan of this location . i think that it wa oddly built- the small , alley-like front make it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or table when it is busy . and there is hardly any table to sit at . furthermore , people tend to clog the front on their way in , which make thing particularly difficult ( especially in the winter weather ) . the staff were pretty impersonal to be , but maybe that wa due to the high traffic of the place and the time i wa there . and the coffee that i had wa cold- i am sure it wa probably the bottom of the batch . i 'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area .
this starbucks is 5-star friendly . the shift supervisor lucious keep the energy in there moving and light . he recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience , kindness , generosity and fairness . i left that afternoon loving starbucks even more than when i went in . it is great that a company and their employee can be a loyal to their customer a their customer are to them .
i am always so pleased with the customer service here . for such a tiny starbucks , the do a really great job serving the mass that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy . outdoor seating in the summer is nice .
this particular starbucks wa especially pushy with offering extra espresso shot when placing my order . this ha never happened before and it took me off guard . the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push . i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
oprah chai latte ! great central spot in this out door mall . staff wa pretty efficient and fast .
starbucks is a chain coffee and tea shop you will find most everywhere . they offer free wifi . they sell their coffee in bag if you like . they also serve sandwich and pastry . some of the starbucks i have seen offer drive through service . price are reasonable.i stopped in here since i have been hunting all over for a gingerbread man cookie . they told me they are getting one in and ugly sweater design but they do not have it yet . i plan to keep checking since it appears that no place i have been to ha my holiday favorite so i will certainly be back to one of their location .
this is a typical starbucks , but in a particularly cramped building without much room to spread out an work if you desire . it is nice that it had a bit of outdoor seating and wifi . over several other coffee alternative nearby in the waterfront , i would rate this a low . barnes and noble ha more comfortable seating and access to many book and other amenity . panera also ha more seating , cheaper coffee and a plethora of menu item to go along with the coffee . the starbucks building style an architecture is attractive , but just too small and limited for this busy waterfront location .
this is actually a very good starbucks . the staff is always nice and they keep the store clean . it is definitely convenient if your down here shopping or going to see a movie . the only thing that stop it from getting 5 star is the parking . considering it in the middle , of the waterfront , parking can be a big problem .
great drink , clean facility , and super friendly staff !
2.5 rounding up only because of the other place on our stop were so bad . first stop on the munhall beer crawl 2011 . it wa just a local dive with local beer . no microbrews or import .
any time ive ever stepped in to randys , there is a very odd smell that immediately make me want to turn around and walk out . bartender dont seem friendly and if you arent a regular , expect to get weird vibe from the regulars.with all of the other option in the area , take your money elsewhere !
very friendly local dive bar . there is nothing special going on here but friendly folk and cold beer . this is exactly the kind of place i like to hang out in .
justine really is the best ! i tried many different groomers before i found her and they could not even come close . she is very patient with the cat and doe a really good quality groom . i would not think about taking my cat smokey to anyone else .
justine ha groomed my very long haired cat with very thick fur three time now and i have nothing but praise for her . my teddy trust her and she ha so much patience with him . i will be bringing him to cat around town again next week . looking forward to it
you have heard of grumpy cat . my gal is cranky cat . she will not let me brush her and brings out the ( substantial ) claw when i , or anyone else , try . she is aging , long haired and often matted . other grooming experience have been unfortunate . ( she injured herself at one place , bit a worker at another and wa sent home unfinished from a third . ) enter cat around town . we were directed to this cats-only salon by a vet tech who recognized our dilemma . the staff at cat around town were unintimidated , but respectful . they made sure my cat felt secure and they took little break when they sensed she wa getting too stressed out . i wa able to be present ( though , frankly , i preferred to sit in the waiting area , visiting with the very friendly resident shop cat ) she came out of there with nail trimmed and fur shaved , looking darling and feeling good . it wa a positive grooming experience ! ! we are spreading the news and looking forward to our next visit .
for someone who straddle the line between sometimes craft-er , this store can seem vast and confusing . there is row and row of basket and bedazzling jewel and paper and ... oh my ... scrap booking ! when i want to find boring old felt ... .it is like ... where do i start ? i am in a hurry , a always , and i rush in and the first thing i look for is an employee . no one to be found . i could call out and my voice would come echoing back . i run between row of paper , wood and gosh darn scrap booking ... .no felt ! where do i find felt ! where do i find an employee ! ? finally , i find one after 15 minute of wondering around . she is incredibly nice and lead me to the felt . this is not the first time i have been hard up to find help . i tell her she wa hard to find , and she tell me that they are `` low on payroll '' and can not have any one the floor but her ! in that whole store , just her ! that is ridic ! not a month ago i wa , again , in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minute to check out , with 2 employee at the register and 6 people per line , i gave up and walked out . hey michael , do you pick up what i am putting down ? you are not making any money because your costumer service suck ... .in fact , there is no service to be found !
i have been frequently shopping at this michael store over the last couple month since i began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home . the store ha typically had the supply that i need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supply . this location is pretty average compared to other michael - it is exactly what you would expect when going to this store . it is not a large store , but it is not a small store -- just average.i do enjoy using the michael is coupon when shopping . i definitely save a lot of money ! instead of toting around the paper version , i actually have the iphone app that ha coupon available to use from the app . my only complaint is that sometimes it take a while to check out at this location . i do not normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower . today , for example , there were only two customer ahead of me , but one of them wa having issue with a coupon . the line began to get longer and longer , and though a couple associate were lingering up front , they kept calling for someone else . from personal experience of being a manger in a retail store , do not linger or let your associate linger near the cashier without jumping on register . whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customer , it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient ... .
it is your typical chain craft store . and let me reiterate that i am not a craft person . i walked in because i needed dial rod for some sign i had . now for being a chain store i wa a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection , the amount they had for each one i wanted were scarce . imagine me standing there with different size of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief . and for a piece of wood , the price wa a bit steep.i will provably come back here , but only for an item that i can not find elsewhere . or if i am too lazy to drive further out .
it is yet another michael is , and it is a very good one . recommended always . for those who love crafting , michael is is a godsend .
the one good thing i can say about michael is is that they have a wide variety of hobby and craft included in their selection . they have got item for woodwork , painting , knitting , kid craft , scrapbook , you name it . the problem is , the variety of product for your particular craft is probably dismal . they have got lot of cool item all over the store that you are convinced that somehow you need . ( because it is soooo cute , and you could totally do something with it . right.. ? ) the store feel cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere . however , if you are looking for something specific , good luck . it is not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store . it is that when you find the right section , there is either nothing in stock , or they simply do not even carry what you need . i stopped in for crochet supply , and the yarn selection wa laughable compared to many other craft store . i ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway . plus the price at michael is are significantly more than other area craft store . i usually only stop there if i am already at tend waterfront . i 'd recommend checking other craft store first . unless you need glitter . especially fine glitter . michael is ha the best glitter selection/quality of any store i have ever been to .
you would think their exorbitant price would at least buy some decent customer service . not at this location . they are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything . this is a problem because they carry so many completely different product that it is hard to find what you need . expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.the organization is disjointed , especially depending on your project . there is even a section called `` art supply '' . i thought that wa kind of the point of the whole store . what did it in however wa how miserably they packed my picture frame . the place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glass in paper to protect them , but apparently michael is think a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather . so , the inevitable happened and i dropped the bag . now i do not expect every place to be sympathetic , even though it could have been packed better , but when i asked for a refund they were down right rude . hey i did drop the thing , but some empathy would have been nice . i wa not completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place . i will never be back to this or any other michael is .
i used michael is for picture framing year ago and wa very pleased . i went back to michael is recently and wa amazed and overwhelmed by the different tool and device for crafting and hobby . a i do not do much of this myself i did not comprehend the significance of many of the items.i wa impressed with the sale staff who with a few word immediately could identify the item you wanted and whether it wa something they stocked . if not , they had suggestion for where else you might find it . bought various crafting item for my girlfriend which she used to help me decorate my living room with . michael also ha a wide variety of storage box useful for home organization . the different size are helpful for planning storage in space of different dimensions.i went back to michael to explore again and found some other useful item . it will likely not be a stop that i frequent weekly but when the fancy to decorate come up , i will count on them for idea .
michael is is one of my favorite store at the waterfront . seems like there is always a sale and there are coupon in the sunday paper all of the time , which encourages me to return . i am a fan of their frame , vas , candle , and holiday decor . on occasion , when i am feeling crafty , i will purchase flower . the staff is helpful . parking is plentiful .
since i moved here , i have been shopping at this michael is location . i go here at least twice a month . and i must say it grown on me . the store is always clean and organized . the associate are usually helpful . and i can i usually find some good deal if not clearance item . though i must admit that the cake decorating class schedule are not a full a here when you compare them to the monroeville location .
1* for the apple map telling me they are open until 10pm . just completed a mad dash here at 9:30pm . yes , i realize i could have called beforehand ...
i dropped by this yankee candle store on saturday to purchase the annual christmas present candle for my mother-in-law . between christmas present purchasing and people wanting their house to smell like balsam and cedar , cinnamon stick , or caramel pecan pie , the little store wa packed . however , i wa greeted immediately when i entered and wa easily able to find the same salesperson again when i had a question . since i wa only purchasing votive candle , i wa initially pleased to see an entire section for the store devoted to them but quickly became frustrated . i could not smell some of the votives through their thick , outside plastic . since the votive candle were not all displayed with their scent , i had to walk from the votive display to the fragrance display to better smell the scent and then walk back . outside of that layout frustration , i had a pleasant experience in the store .
this is smaller store than one i have seen inside mall , but they seem to have all of the necessity . they have a great collection of candle ! my favorite were in the `` relax '' section . turquoise sky & home sweet home were great ! i am not a huge fan of food scented candle , but they actually had very nice one ! apple pumpkin wa great and surprisingly i loveddddd christmas cookie ! the employee were all helpful .
yankee candle ha high quality candle that smell wonderful . they burn evenly and for a long time . i tend to purchase when there is a sale because the candle are pricey . ( yc is also sold at other retailer like kohl , bed bath & beyond and burlington ) . i stock up on the votive candle when they are $ 1 . yc also carry reed diffusers/oils , car freshener , wax melt , and decor . never had an issue with customer service . the staff is friendly . this store is fairly small , but ha a nice variety of fragrance and accessory .
whenever i wa at the waterfront i would eat here . the shake are good , a are the shoestring fry and baked bean . the sandwich are small thin patty of meat so you probably want at least a double . overall , pretty tasty .
the food is good and it cheap.i mean really inexpensive. $ 4.00 for a burger and fry . add a coke and it like $ 10.00- $ 13.00 for two people . seldom if ever crowded . service can be a tad slow but hit or miss.they also do breakfast and it a great alternative to waiting at eat and park.try the shake , they are great .
it clean , open 24/7 with hot shoe string fry and creative milkshake . what else do you want in life ? ?
this is the absolute worst steak n shake i have ever been to . the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for 40 min . trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food , the food itself wa just so crappily made . it wa so bad and we had waited a ridiculous amount of time ( c'mon , steak n shake is basically a glorified mcd is ) , our waiter comped our whole meal.if not for the compensation , i would have been pissed that we had to pay for such a crappy meal . the bf , on the other hand , wa more upset about the principle of the matter ... we had trekked all that way just to get our steak n shake fix ( since both of u have not had it since our undergraduate day ) and it wa a major fail.i think i am good with my steak n shake craving for a long time now ... p . the whole joint smell like major b.o .
i went here at 3 pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush , and the restaurant wa maybe 20 % full . i ordered the chili mac supreme to go . i thought i would be in and out within 5-10 minute . keep in mind that this restaurant even ha a drive-thru ; the expectation is quick service.long story short , my food never came ... the waitress told me ( after i had been sitting there waiting for thirty minute ) that the kitchen had not even started on my order yet , so i told her to cancel it and walked out . now i see that others on yelp have warned about the slow service at this location . wish i had looked it up earlier .
i heart steak n shake . i love the fact that the fry are shoestring , the burger get to you pretty fast , they are a little greasy , and the food is super cheap.i visited steak and shake on new year is eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying . i wa unnaturally attracted to their wisconsin buttery burger , which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onion between two bun that have been buttered . sound good right ? well , i get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my bun had been dunked in butter . the pearly gate of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angel were singing to me . i took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the bun and i literally got tear in my eye ... .most likely from the salt overload , but possibly because this wa one of the most evilly decadent thing i had eaten in a long time.this is not meant to be a fine dining experience . service wa not fast but it wa not slow . it just kind of wa . however , the waitress did get a point for explaining that the order would take x amount of time to all patron . so i give them a pas for being upfront about it.next trip to pgh is going to feature steak and shake - i guarantee it .
well ... a steak 'n shake location go , this is not the best one around -- but it is burger and fry that are open 24-7.the milkshake are good ! pro : always made fresh , when you order ; con : greasy ( but it burger ) ; take longer than typical in drive thru ( but that is bc they are made fresh ! ) ; service ( on a scale of 1-10 , 10 being awesome ) is a 4 .
in general i do like shake n ' steak , but this location is a hit or miss location ! you never know what kind of quality or service you are going to find here . a friend and myself went a few week back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trip there ever ! you can not entirely blame the waitress since she wa the only one there for the entire place ... poor scheduling on the manager is part . however , while she can not be accountable for the slooooow service , she wa accountable for both order being incorrect . the burger were over cooked and the fry were soggie and the milkshake wa runny at best ... by far my worst visit to steak n ' shake !
rather typical sn . had a good lunch crowd . milkshake wa good but not a good a enp down the street . it took to long to get the burger for some reason , 25 minute , i realized cooked to order but this is a little long for sn . ordered the guacamole steakburger and it only had a small portion of gauc ... not your usual amount..kitchen wa not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason . definitely did not look like the picture on the website . oh well !
ah , steak n shake , you hit the spot after a night of drinking . open 24 hour , drive thru or dine in , with wonderful , cheap greasy burger , chicken finger , breakfast sandwich , and shoestring fry . you are faster ( and cheaper ! ) than eat n park . plus your employee wear those adorable bow tie . granted , if we were at a fancy party , i might act like i do not know you , but deep down inside you know i heart you .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
this wa the most horrible experience at a restaurant i have had in year ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i wa there at around 9pm , with about 9 folk from my family ( visiting relative included ) . there were several thing that got me annoyed , one after another . i wa ok that it took a while for u to be seated . but after we ordered , what really got me angry wa that the food took a very long time to arrive . we had 2 kid with u and we ordered 2 kid meal , and had asked for those to be brought sooner . after about 25-30 minute of nothing , i went to the server ( who were just not paying attention to u anyway - the main server is name for our table wa angel ) and asked where our meal were . one checked with another , who then informed me that they were working on it . what made me even angrier is that they tried to downplay everything , telling me that it had only been 5 minute . then one of the server ( manager ? ) tell me that `` ok , may be it is been 10 minute , but it is coming '' . then i hear some of the server talking about our order . the same gentleman then came to our table , sat down next to me and told me that it is only been 10 minute and that they were working on our order , and tried to give me some explanation about why that is not really a long time at all . it wa clearly almost half an hour or longer by that time . the food finally arrived about 10 minute after that . but the food came cold . we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could . neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drink even once . i had to ask for mine , but by that point i wa in no mood to take a sip even . i paid ( $ 58.20 ) and i again got the same gentleman who tried ( again ! ) to explain to me that it wa just 10 minute , and that `` given everything , we were within normal limit '' . wow . after about an hour and half at the restaurant , we all just shook our head and left . i have written to them on their website , and will see if they follow up . we have vowed never to go to this restaurant again . yikes ! !
this wa the first time that i have ever eaten here . we went through the drive thru which took forever . i ordered a hamburger and onion ring . the hamburger did taste kind of odd but i figured it wa because i am used to wendy is . exactly 6hours later i wa so sick . might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange . i dont think that i need to go back to this particular location ... ... ever
terrible wait staff could not even seat u . before we , and another party walked out without even being greeted properly , i observed several employee traipse out the front door , several table who were waiting for their food for a long time , several employee just standing around out of direct view of the table , a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other . i think one server wa high . going there wa a special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness , so that make the shabby treatment more enraging .
this place is s l o w ... .like so slow i have got up and left after waiting 30 minute and not even being acknowledged by a server . the food is okay . def not worth the wait . milkshake are just okay a well . booooooo .
i really like the chili . burger are fair and salad are pretty bad . pretty hard to mess up a side salad . a others have said you never know what kind of service you will get . store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair . the staff is usually disinterested with customer and sometimes outright rude . all in all what you pay is what you get . cheap and crap service .
fast food done right , what more can you want ? a throwback to old timey diner , steak and shake is where you get a decent meal at a good price . my sister and i arrived on a tuesday afternoon around 3pm catching their 2-4 happy hour , which we read on the door upon entry ; a lovely surprise . this meant that all shake and drink were 50 % off ! i ordered the western bbq burger , which wa 2 thin patty , cheese , bacon , bbq sauce , and fried onion . it came with shoe string fry ( my favorite ) , all for the low price of $ 4.79 . are you kidding me ? what is not to like ! the food wa actually pretty good ! i liked it a lot . since it wa happy hour i also `` splurged '' on a chocolate covered strawberry shake . it wa meh . could have gone without it . the overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off , but the hot fudge saved it . but , how can you really go wrong with hot fudge ? all in all , 3 meal and 3 shake came to $ 20 . a steal . also the food is good ! i enjoyed it . i 'd come back .
fast food in a resturant setting . considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go . must be a reason why this place is always packed .
the food is good . unfortunately the service is very hit or miss . the main issue seems to be with the kitchen , the waiter and waitress are often very apologetic for the long wait and it is pretty obvious that some of them avoid the table after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaint .
food is good , what you 'd expect from steak n shake . the service is awful . so incredibly awful . expect to take at least an hour for your meal , even when it is slow . i have been going here for year when i want a cheap meal , but the service is so so so awful . go to mcdonalds .
the service wa fast but the food wa terrible and so wa the service . i had a bus to catch so i could not wait around waiting for the check so i went to the counter to pay . she never brought my check , never checked to see if my drink needed refilled , she just mopped the floor . the burger wa really greasy , the fry were luke warm and the cheese on them wa not a flavorful a it should be . a a new pittsburgher i am not impressed .
i should have known better than to stop here , but i wa nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple . i should kick myself for thinking of this place.granted i decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait . the sign actually say that the food is prepared when you order it . i sat for almost ten minute at the window while my food wa prepared . during that time i wished i could have taken back my order and also wished that i had not paid already . while sitting at the window i decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employee doing their job . what disturbed me the most wa watching the employee making the milkshake . making a milkshake is not that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch . what disgusted me wa that the guy actually lifted several of the container for the milkshake and smelt them . i mean smelt them to see if they were clean , instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container . after witnessing this my food wa finally ready and i drove away.when i finally got to eating my food i wa underwhelmed . the fry had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered . the `` steakburger '' really , they should just call it a burger , wa overpowered by the bbq sauce on it . it wa all i could taste.all this ha cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishment ever again .
i do not think it is too much to ask that if you advertise your drive thru being open 24/7 . then it should be open 24/7 . i work a late night job . the past three time i have tried to get food late night i have not been able to . twice they greeted me in the drive thru and never got back to me after twenty minute so i drove away . tonight they told me that the drive thru wa closed . really ? awful location . awful service . went inside to try to get food , but i wa ignored by the staff . how hard doe it have to be to get a burger ? do not go here .
you know what you are getting with a steak n shake : it is about one rung up from a mcd is in quality , and about two rung down in quickness . at least , you think you know . i used to have a small place in my heart ( though the salt and fat were not very kind to said organ ) for steak n shake , because hey , who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream ? but after my last trip , i can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here , this location in particular . i have not been back in over year , and i will never step foot into a steak n shake a long a i have an immune system that i care about . after having eaten here , i hit the restroom on my way out ( along with my two friend ... .hey , we are girl , it is acceptable ! ) . one stall wa already taken , so two of u are stuck waiting while this occupant doe her ... .shall we say , business ? after a few second , we realize that she is not only there to relieve herself , but to also take drive-through order . yes , that is right ... . '' you want fry with that ? *flush* okay , that will be $ 5.50 '' . i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane a a drive-through restroom . to top it off , after finishing her `` bathroom break '' , she walk straight out of the stall and into the restaurant . i guess she wa in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she did not have time to wash her hand . and i wa in too much of a rush to choke back up what i had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach .
i love steak n shake . this one , however , leaf a lot to be desired . the food often come out cold and the server are apathetic at best . most of the time , they are downright rude . i highly recommend avoiding this location if possible . there is one on route 51 that is worth the 15 minute it will take you to get there .
i never thought that i 'd be giving steak 'n shake a 4 star review , but i really enjoyed my dinner here tonight . it just hit the spot ! i wa impressed by our waiter a soon a we walked through the door . he apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he wa the only waiter working at that time . however , everything wa delivered promptly , and he made what would have been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.i ordered a grilled cheese and fry . the grilled cheese wa well cooked and filled with tasty , perfectly melty cheese . i love steak 'n shake is thin and crispy fry , and these were a delicious a i had expected.for just $ 9 for me and my husband , i have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive steak 'n shake wa . based on the cost , the food , and our fantastic waiter , we will be back soon .
i like the occasional steak and shake stop ... .. but this one ha to be the slowest one ever . the cashier wa rude and i could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register wa not working the way she wanted ... . wow ... . just wow ...
every time we come here the service is laughably bad . on this visit a tabe which wa sat after u had their food before our server graced u with her surly presence . good restaurant elsewhere , just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour .
wow . dirty and slow . the floor felt like they had the day burger grease spilled all over , and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order .
this place teeter between a 2 and a 3 star review . i have had pretty good experience inside , it is usually the drive-thru where thing fall a part . it is the rare place i can get a frisco melt well , the only place i can get a frisco melt ! and that steak burger alone is worth the risk , walk in or drive thru.just take a gun on weekend , you will be fine .
the staff is very rude at the drive thru to the point of telling me at 2:02 pm `` it is only 1:59 you can not do the happy hour shake yet ! '' she literally screamed it at me . the management doe not enforce any kind of health code in that restaurant either . i too , have witnessed employee not washing hand , and i have gotten food poisoning twice from undercooked burger . once - shame on you , twice - shame on me - will not go there again . the lovely occaisional drug deal out in the parking lot at night doe not help either when you have kid .
this location is terrible . the drive-thru worker are rude and they give you crap food . i waited 5 minute before being able to order , even when there wa only 1 car ahead of me . then the lady proceeded to ask me if i would like anything on my burger , and ( thinking the picture on the menu are what they are supposed to look like and they would never false advertise ) i asked `` doe not it come with the fixing like in the picture ? '' she then told me it only come with cheese . so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger . pulled around and got my order pretty quick , but later when i open my burger it just meat and cheese . the meat is badly burned and cold . it wa clear to me this burger wa not fresh . i did not even attempt to eat it , what a waste of a place . they definitely need better worker .
awful in every category . the service is the worst i have ever seen . we were waiting to be seated in this half empty restaurant for 5 minute before the manager came over and seated one couple . then with more people waiting he went to the counter and took out a rag and started wiping it down . we were still being ignore until i told him it wa alright we did not need a table and left . i do not know how corporate keep this place open . i have complained numerous time but it never doe any good.take the extra 20 minute to drive to the south hill location . it pretty much the exact opposite of the waterfront . the food come out hot and properly cooked and you are not ignored by the staff .
steak 'n shake is food is pretty good and the price are not bad for the quantity of food . i ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing . the salad looked thrown together and wa $ 5.49 for 2 crouton , tomato , carrot , cabbage , lettuce and chicken breast . ( they forgot the cheese ! ) the staff wa not very friendly or helpful and seemed like they did not want to be there . there usually is a long wait at steak 'n shake , but if you catch them when they are not busy , you will breeze through- drive-thru that is . i do like their food and you can eat healthy option , but the staff is not helpful and the quality is not always there .
it is okay . food is cheap but portion are small . for example i order the chicken tender , and i got 3 little tiny tender , and a decent amount of fry . also the restaurant is not really clean either . this restaurant is not my number 1 choice .
i like to eat here because the food ha always been good and kid eat free on the weekend which is great . but this location is always woefully understaffed , with five or six table sitting unbussed while people wait to be seated . whether you are inside or at the drive through the wait is incredibly long . fortunately the staff are always friendly despite the ridiculous staffing level the management maintains here .
i am not a fan of this chain is food or this location service.however ! steak n shake milkshake totally rock . very thick , regular is the perfect size to get me home from the waterfront .
i really do not know how this place stay open . i have been here a couple of time . the service is slooooow . they bring you your food which is never the way you ordered it , put your bill on the table and never come back to check on you . if the place wa packed i could understand but it is usually about half full . on our last visit it took u 10 minute to get our waitress attention . we asked for some mustard , mayo , lettuce , and tomato for our burger . it took 5 minute to get the mustard and mayo . the lettuce and tomato never came . it is safe to say that we will not be back . we like the food and shake but not worth it to put up with the poor service .
fell asleep last night before i did my review what i can say about this place is their food is good their milkshake r awesome i had gotten the chicken finger with fry & a birthday cake milkshake which wa delish we got seated pretty fast & our waiter wa very polite & professional
drive through service is better than going inside if you want takeout . food is always served hot- inside it just take a lot longer than it should , both to get waited on at the counter and for the food to come . also , the lid on the milkshake cup are awful and fall off easily . make sure to hold on tight !
the hostess ( jenn of jess , i am not sure ) is atrocious . i am autistic and asked to be moved from right beside the kitchen because of noise level , and she made a huge deal of it . i ended up cry outside waiting for my partner to let me know we 'd been moved . 15 minute later , we had still not been moved or gotten food , and my partner and i left . this is 1:45 pm on a thursday . not at all busy . just bad service . our waitress wa very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problem . but today wa completely different . i arrived 12:15 pm to have lunch with my family . we sat there for about 25 minute and not one person came to ask u if we were ready to order . they completely ignored u so we got up and left . one table near u had to flag a waitress just to get her attention . so we went to wendy is up on 8th avenue and we had no problem ar all .
slow service . food is very cheap though . the milkshake are huge thick and yummy . sometimes when i go here , they completely ignore you when your the only person in line . the burger were good and the menu is pretty small . food take about an hour to come when no one even there ! i would go here if the service wa faster and better .
i know service speed is not a chain-wide issue . this place is just really . slow . we ordered 40 minute ago . still no food .
i ordered online last night and it wa suppose to be done at 7 : ! 5pm . i get their small line that somehow took 30mins . when i get to counter she look at my print out and say it will be done in a few . i ask to speak to manager and she call out a manager named rachel who did not show . at 8:05pm she go to check my food after me saying something ! it wa on the counter the whole time . my food wa cold and they have to the nerve to say come again . i think not !
dear my fine brother , a man once asked me : have you ever seen the rain ? well i have . the burger were charred to a crust-encased oblivion . imagine world war 3 . and by god , the viscosity of the milkshake wa uncouth . 1/5
..such an upsetting experience here . my family life an hour away and came in town for dinner and dave & buster . we knew d & b is food wa overpriced and always a long wait so we decided on here . we were a party of 6 adult and 1 kid . raquan wa our server and he wa so nice . he took our order but sadly we waited 45 minute for it to com.everyone around u who just ordered 15 minute before already had their food . i have worked at steak n shake before . it le than 10 minute to cook both the burger and fry . i have no idea if kitchen lost our ticket or what but i did see our server talking to them more than once about our order so atleast he wa on top of it.the manager here need better training . he stood at the register the entire time cashing people out even though clearly the kitchen wa behind and customer in the dining area were angry ( saw a couple leave after waiting for server and another table talk to manager about wait time ) . again i have worked at another steak n shake . the counter girl is responsible for cashing people out and take out orders.. manager should helping on the grill or over-seeing everything going on . poor raquan had to keep coming over to apologize whenever the manager should have . who tf trained the bos here ? sadly after an hour at the restaurant and 45 minute waiting on food , we told our server we had to leave . he told u dont worry about the drink . we tipped him and went to eat at chikfila . at least the rest of the night wa fun at d & b . shoutout to raquan . you are the real mvp
i waited 20 minute for charred hamburger . the bottle of seasoning on the table wa a cute idea bc lord know it did not have any seasoning on it . the waitress kept saying that they were backed up but when i looked around there wa not a lot of people there . however they ( waitress ) were nice and apologetic . but when i think of steak sandwich i did not think of what i got .
my goal of 2016 is to write more yelp review ... so here we are . my boyfriend and i just spent an hour at target getting stuff for our new house . we were hungry and wanted to grab something quick , so we went to steak and shake . i would first like to note that their parking lot and sidewalk had not been salted ... not really the best idea considering it is been icy out for two day now . anyways , we made it inside and it wa pretty crowded . we were seated within 5 minute of coming in . the service wa ok , nothing special . i ordered the single cheeseburger and cheese fry . my boyfriend got the bacon cheeseburger and cheesy bacon fry . our food came out pretty quickly and it wa the way we ordered it ( i ordered everything on my burger while my boyfriend only ordered cheese and bacon ) . our food wa good , i have no complaint . if you are looking for a quick and cheap bite to eat , then this is your place !
server took 15 minute to even seat me , then 10 more to even take my order . found out they did not even have what i wanted , a common accurance lately . once i had got my drink ( cola with a shot of cherry ) , it wa flat and tasted a little like cough syrup . their first attempt at my meal , grilled cheese steak burger melt ( in essence a steak burger on a grilled cheese ) , i wa served just a plain grilled cheese . once they had gotten me another sandwich , it seemed right except for the awkward stack of pickle in the middle , not spread out . it may seem a little nitpickey at this point , but this is by far the worst experience i have had at this restaurant , but not the first . i do not think i will be returning to suffer through that again .
waitress wa very kind at the beginning but her attitude declined rapidly . food wa alright except the french onion soup . could not believe the waitress thought it wa okay to serve . a table nearby had a problem with their food . waitress wa rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue . terrible customer service .
look so many better burger . aint no steak and no shake . ice milk at best . five guy burger much better . frosty and a daves classic much better at same price . spend a few more and goto bgr
this is the worst place i have maybe ever been to . the outside wa filthy with trash all over . the inside wa maybe worse , trash and dirty . the employee were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing . i can not even guess how unsanitary it might be . disgusting .
i keep forgetting how not good this location is.inconvenienced hostess seat the party before you without even acknowledging your presence . disinterested , apathetic server that ignore request like `` we need napkin '' until you have finished your meal and erupted your hand on your clothing . cook meet my food quality expectation , but give barely child sized portion on side dish . i have not seen one staff member smile the entire time i have been in here today.i consistently return to the rt 51 location because i get decent and consistent service . this one ? i only returned because i wa getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
a far a i am concerned , filene is basement is good for two thing : cheap dress and cheap accessory .

a a young performer , i need good-looking dress for frequent audition -- and i need a couple , so i am not wearing the same thing every time . the dress on the second floor usually range from $ 30-60 and are good for over a year . it can be hard to find a full-length dress that is not reminiscent of a prom dress , but their selection of cocktail-length dress is ample .

a far a accessory go , filene is tends to have cheap version of popular trend . if i feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad , filene is is the place to go .
even when we did not have a car filene is basement wa worth the bus trip to the waterfront . i always find something ( usually i find 3-4 thing and spend about $ 60 ) and better still , i am always still wearing the clothes and shoe 3 month later . i kind of suspect this is the best shopping in pittsburgh ; it is much better than the usual department store , better than marshall is and tj maxx and better than the saks downtown , even when it ha a sale . selection , bargain and quality.i like this filene is better than gabriel brother , which are harder to get to . gabriel brother are a real discount shopper is challenge and i am afraid i did not live in pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skill . . . filene is wa still up and running in june 2007 when i left town .
love this store ! do not always have much luck with the sale , but i always find something i like here . this is not your average marshall is or tj max . i think the green dress i am wearing is from filene is !
this is probably my favorite store in pittsburgh , for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing . other store carry the same stuff but for much , much more , and it is hard to find all the stuff that the basement carry in one spot . ( yes , i admit that the 'burgh ha some cool store . ) i would do most of my clothes shopping here if i were here more often .
another store which ha gone the way of the dodo bird . actually there wa nothing basement like about it . what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
this store is sadly not in business any more
$ 9.75 for a red bull and vodka ? i am sorry , i thought i wa in pittsburgh , not new york city . sing sing , a dueling piano bar , is fun , but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if i could have more than one watered down drink before i warbled my way through `` paradise city '' with the rest of the crowd .
really enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would . the drink were on the pricey side , but i did not head here to get smashed .
had a great time at sing sing a while ago with friend . friendly staff . will return .
piano man to the tune of gangster is paradise ... what more do i have to say ? get there early if you want a seat , $ 7 cover and really fun crowd . we had sucha great time and i can not wait to go back .
singsing ! ! ! what a blast ! one of my favorite place to jam on earth ! ! cool bar , cool town , cool people ... what else do you need ! ! the piano player are great , funny , semi-good lookin ' ... i mean dude , you got ta go ! ! ! : ) love me some singsing !
well , the experience did not start well . when we walked in the singing we heard wa not good . oy wa it not good ... thankfully , it ( mostly ) improved from there.so there were 3 piano player rotating out on a half hour basis . so each wa on for an hour and off for half . of the 3 , two were really good . good singer , good piano player , and very funny . the third guy , well , not so much . piano skill were fine . but his singing wa not . when he sang in his range , he wa not too bad actually , but too often he reached for note that he could not get to or forced thing that just were not going to happen . often his joke fell completely flat . luckily the other two usually did most the talking.they played a variety of song a requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional style if requested ( closer by nin a sung by a lounge singer wa a highlight ) . we requested britney spear ' toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and a luck would have it , it turned out really good . that take some serious talent to pull off . if they did not know it ( like toxic ) they 'd find it and play it . they played a wide variety of stuff.part of the experience is based on the crowd . we had a couple larger group ( there on a thursday night , so smallish group in general ) that they interacted with a lot , providing some running joke and comedy . of course , that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.my friend were big fan of the super cheap beer special . $ 1 draft from rock bottom next door . the waitress wa not great but it could have been that she wa the only one there and the layout is not that easy to navigate . the bar wa generally uncrowded though so getting service there wa fast.if in the waterfront for a night out , definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes . having a fun loving group of friend to mock thing with when they go off the rail a bit will help make it more fun .
while we were in pittsburgh for the winter classic on new year day , we figured we 'd see what the area had to offer for nye . my wife and i , along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up sing sing in homestead . it is apparently located on what wa the site of one of the largest steel mill in the area . when it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development . the only remaining artifact from what once wa , were the nine or so original mill smoke stack still standing at the primary entrance . pretty cool.sing sing , which is a piano bar , is attached to the rock bottom brewery and serf a selection of rbb is in-house brew and share a similar menu . there are no tv is , no sport memorabilia ( which is rare for this city ) , and no big booth for large group . this place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musician . mind you this is not a bad thing , just note that if you want a bar , go next door or across the street to dave and buster . i 'd say sing sing hold about 150 people seated.this particular night they were hosting a ( shocker ) nye is party . for $ 40 buck a person you got a choice of two entree ( beef tenderloin tip or lemon chicken ) , veggie , mashed potato , one free drink coupon , a midnight champagne toast , and , what turned out to be over four hour of non-stop music . again ... pretty cool.there were three musician holding down the fort playing more than just piano ( drum , electric synth , bass guitar , and apparently i missed the sax ) . there wa plenty of crowd involvement . a in most piano bar you request song along with a tip . the larger the tip , the better chance of hearing your song you have . i put three request on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played . their rendition of toto is africa wa fantastic and surprisingly , my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guy actually knew the tune and word to the theme from tv is `` growing pain . '' i wa sold from that point on.i will take this time to note that this is not a family friendly joint . i am not sure if it wa 21+ only but i certainly would not bring anyone too young to drive . a good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced . i think rail mixed drink were $ 7.00 and beer were 6 or so ( rbb doe not brew anything i particularly enjoy so i stuck with rum and coke ) . all and all my bill wa not scary and i am not used to that on dec 31st . waitress staff wa really nice and incredibly attentive . no complaint there . the only down side to everything wa group seating a you are sitting at 2-top cab table . it wa easily fixed though a the group next to u wa up for rearranging table from side to side to front to back ( allowing u to talk and share food/booze etc ) , also , being a tourist , we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in homestead . understandably nye ha it issue with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hour for a cab because , a we found out , homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drive . ooops ! all and all a good time and someplace i 'd certainly return to if for any reason i 'd be back in pittsburgh ... a long a i have a car .
in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it . it get expensive because you drink , maybe start to sing a few lyric , drink some more , think of a song you wan na hear , put $ 5 and title of said song on a piece of paper , you drink , they play it , everyone else is trying to get their song played so you put $ 10 on your next sticky note ... and so on and so forth . i wa not really into it when i first got there but a the night went on and lager went in i started to warm up to the place . i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time , it is not worth it . but again , that is just me.the 2 star are for the piano player , who are entertaining and very talented , and the rock bottom brew they serve .
so.much.fun ! i wish i could play a song at the drop of a hat . too bad i never took piano lesson and i 'd probably end up mumbling half the lyric other than the chorus . unless it is salt n ' pepa is shoop . this is a really great place to go when you have out of town guest or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out . it is just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bar on a saturday night . keep in mind you will be paying around a $ 5-10 cover plus whatever drink and food you get . the good thing is the food is coming from the attached rock bottom brewery . so a lot of it is restaurant quality good . plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good ! of course you will be paying restaurant price drink ... so of course they are up charged a bit . but you do pay for the whole experience ... .so you got ta get into the spirit with some spirit ! the guy who play are incredibly talented . there is 2 guy that will take request and play song on the piano . they pretty much play anything you ask . contemporary song , throw back song , fight song , rap song , pop song . you name it , they play it . my favorite part is when they switch out to another two guy . they will all four get on stage and play two piano is , a guitar and drum . they usually rock out with some fun familiar song ( um , journey , of course ! ) . the birthday song is seriously the best . they sing to you ... .and call you some name ... .with expletive . but in a totally nice way of course . you just have to go !
dueling piano bar in pittsburgh started at station square , and they died out . then when the chain restaurant magnet `` waterfront '' opened in 2000 the parent company of the rock bottom brewery decided to open sing sing in back of the brewery.when it first opened it wa pretty cool . the very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovation . i know , i wa there . from stairway to heaven to free bird , stayin ' alive to she is my cherry pie , elton john to the bos , they were amazing at sounding like the band they were covering . equally incredible were the obscure song that audience member would shout out , song only you though you knew , and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song , sounding like the band who is song they sung.but today , sing sing seems like it is stuck in the early part of the 21st century . the whole dueling piano , shout out a song to stump the band , sing u a song you are the piano man ha run it is course . i do not hate sing sing , but i could never come here more than once a year . it is a been there , done that kind of place .
if you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night , go to sing sing : ) if you send a dollar up with a song request , they will play it . if they do not know it , they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like , or they will look up the lyric and sing it ! ! they aim to please : ) i have definitely been pleased : )
sing sing is awesome ! ! give a buck or more and they will play anything , and if they do not know it , they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy ! : ) great humor too ! ! : )
what a great time ! this place wa awesome ! i wish i lived right down the road , because i could see myself being a regular here.honestly , these guy have got some talent , like real talent . they can play the piano , sing , play guitar , and the drum . did i mention that they are all pretty hilarious , too . i 'd easily pay the $ 7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it . i am sure i will be back in no time at all . next time , i am bringing a big group of friend .
came here with a group of girl and did not have a reservation . we paid the cover , walked in and it wa absolutely packed . there wa nowhere to even stand . one of our friend wa having issue with an expired license and when we found out that not all of u got in , they let u get our $ 7 cover back without issue . i recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seat . people who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff wa very helpful in dealing with the group . they brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brand . there are only about 6 beer on top , so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choice . they also have mixed drink and wine . the mixed drink around about $ 9 and they have a limited number of bottled wine ( despite what it say on the menu ) . the entertainment wa great and i would recommend it for a group outing . but definitely make sure that you have a reservation .
lame . lame a heck.the premise seemed kind of fun , but when i got there it did not take long for sing sing to disappoint . the $ 7 cover wa way too high for this place , and the drink were not good . the music the guy played wa all stuff from like 1987 . nothing modern , mostly stuff you would hear on bob fm during the two o'clock hour at work . the medley from grease wa a crowd pleaser i guess.part of their schtick is that if a member of your party is having a birthday or wedding or what have you then you can pay to have that person dragged on stage and they will sing a song to them . they were doing dirty version of well known song , and there wa really only one joke . `` hey there delilah '' became `` hey there v****a '' and that wa the cleverest one . hope you like 7th grade dirty joke , because you will be hearing a lot of them . mostly one that you already know from 7th grade.i would not recommend anybody go . i want my brain cell back .
this place ha gone significantly down hill . i have gone to sing sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 year . when we started going there you could not get a seat unless you got there early . it wa always packed . however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller . crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all . i wa there last saturday night ( 8/4/12 ) and there wa about 20-30 people there . very slow and boring . it appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage , taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be . this wa likely my last time at sing sing . save your $ 7 and skip this place . a real shame because this place wa once a lot of fun .
had an absolute blast ! ! great for any crowd , any occasion , any age ! ashley the waitress wa amazing
picture billy joel is `` piano man '' doubled mixed with beer , a rowdy crowd , and comedy - welcome to sing sing ! a unique musical experience found in homestead.if you are looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer , come on in ! serving food and brew from rock bottom brewery , sing sing keep your tummy full while you listen to two ( or more ) amazingly talented pianist take your musical request . they will play anything you 'd like , for tip of course . wanting to hear britney spear ? toto ? duran duran ? yep , they play that ... new or old.the crowd make the show , so make sure you come ready for a good time . if the crowd is dead , it is harder for the guy to get a reaction . if you are wanting to have some fun , it can be a great time ! it is the perfect place for birthday party - especially if you want to embarrass a friend . the guy will bring them up to the piano and perform a little ditty . for being a good sport , you get the coveted sing sing bumper sticker . now who would not want that ? dueling piano and brew ... time to shut up & sing sing !
first time here tonight and i must say i wa not sure if i wanted to go . it seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but i decided to go with friend and man did i have a blast . the $ 7 door charge wa great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1 ) . the food wa not super but good price reasonable . the beer left something to b desired a they r a micro brewery so u can only get their craft . i asked for something similar to yeungling but what i got wa nothing like it . the musician were great they made this place awesome . we will b back and this may b our new pittsburgh hangout
went here for the first time this past weekend . needle to say i will be returning ! it wa a blast ! ! ! it wa cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table . though it wa very annoying that people had reserved table right up front and never showed up . what is wrong with these people ? ! everything if you ask me ! seriously though if you are going to reserve a table , you better freaking go ! i had no complaint about the place itself ! the guy were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple time wa just the cherry on top ! anddd this ha to be the only place i have ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk , because the comedian take no prisoner ! i did enjoy when matt and joey were the one up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better ! they are great at what they do . can not wait to go back !
my friend is a piano teacher , so i took it a a good sign that sing sing would be quality stuff . it wa her birthday , and i did not really know anything about dueling piano bar . i wa picturing glossy black grand piano with glittering note , pianist in black jacket and crystal glass full of red wine . i am really , really glad i wa wrong . it wa gritty , bawdy and quintessentially pittsburgh . first off , the piano are scuffed to hell , considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated . the musician hammer away at them , and they are covered with n @ and sing sing sticker . it is obvious they have been well-loved . the music is anything but the elevator music i wa picturing ; it is rock , hip-hop , oldie , pop , and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system ( send up a piece of paper with some money ) and the amazing repertoire of the musician . for instance , `` rubber ducky '' and `` gangsta is paradise '' were both featured when i wa there , and both performed impeccably . they also honored a request for a taylor swift song only to receive $ 30 and a request for `` anything else , '' which they promptly followed . the musician also do funny version of popular song , and throw in thing like `` yinz '' instead of `` you . `` i saw in awe of the performer for a decent portion of the night . it must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this , considering the energy , confidence , wit , empathy , boldness , silliness , cleverness , and sheer talent a job like this requires . they rotate performer in and out so there is not even an intermission . i have read comment about the baseness of the humor , but i had no doubt the guy up on stage were intelligent dude . they had great personality : one wa about 140 pound , cheeky , and quick-witted . he acted out every sport in the winter olympics , and wa pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called joan . the other had crazy hair and bright blue chuck , beatboxed a well a he sang , and made it point to play a handful of song for my friend is birthday . `` i think ray charles is the most soulful guy of all time , '' he said when she requested him.there were ton of people celebrating birthday , and one big bachelorette party the saturday night i wa there . the performer bring the birthday boy/girl , bachelor/bachelorette , etc . on stage ( for a $ 20 tip , which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friend ) and humiliate the hell out of them , i.e . this is not the place to be if you can not laugh at yourself . my friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano , and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.luckily , the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced , weak drink , because those did feature heavily throughout the night . the rest of the staff wa friendly , however , and i stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself , which made me smile.sing sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing ( much like hofbräuhaus ) , but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion . definitely belongs on every required pittsburgh experience list .
always a good time , although it is definitely not a place i would visit often . it is great for group ... .which is quite obvious since there are always several folk there for bachelorette party and birthday . shut out to the piano player , who can not only play the piano , but also sing , play the drum and the sax . they are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained . also know some pretty obscure song . my big criticism is the set up . if you do not have a reservation and/or come later in the evening , it is difficult to get seat . believe me , i do not mind standing , but it doe become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitress and patron past you . if you do find a seat , it is often littered with someone else is empty glass .
the musician at this place work hard to entertain the crowd , so i can not say they are all bad . however the minimum for a song request is $ 5 . i spent $ 20 on a song for my girlfriend and they never played it ! ! they were playing song for $ 5 and $ 10 , but my $ 40 got me no where . even if they did not know the song , which i doubt , they could have picked one they knew and improvised , my tip , save your $ $ on the requests.otherwise it is fun for special event every once in awhile .
i went here with a bachelorette party . we had reservation , which wa good because it wa packed that saturday night . the performer were very talented , but the acoustic were strangely off . the theme that ran through the whole show wa , to quote some phrase they kept repeating , `` you bitch , you slut , you whore '' and `` twinkle twinkle little slut , why do not you take it up the butt '' which one of the pianist wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage ... you get the idea ? perhaps if i had not been the designated driver , alcohol would have made these joke funny the fifth , sixth , seventh time . or maybe not .
he wa incredibly sexist/homophobic . he could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he did not like another on stage who could actually dance with the girl .
pretty fun place to go every once in a while , but , believe me , by the end of the night you will be ready to go . the show last around 5 hour , by the 3 hour mark you will be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $ 9 a pop drink listening to the same dirty joke over and over and over again .
my best friend took me to sing sing for my bachelor party . i had a blast . the musician ( dueling pianist ) made fun of me in a bunch of song . they also were really good at playing requested tune ( rock ) . when the show wa over we shuffled across the hall to the connected `` rock bottom '' restaurant for some grub . we all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy is bachelor party.there were some drawback though . we went on a thursday night so the atmosphere wa lacking a the place wa pretty empty . and of course they are a little pushy soliciting tip when the place is empty . but it is not our fault the place is empty on thirsty thursday , if their drink were not so damn expensive maybe more people would show up . and sometimes they used vulgar language which wa just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious . also there wa no table service , and the only bartender wa a bitch . i will probably be back , but only for a special occasion when i can afford it .
talented piano player , but i found it annoying they kept pushing for tip all night long . we got the message . server wa nice and song were good . it wa super loud in there so be prepared . super crowded saturday night so make sure you come early
what a great time ! the pianist are funny , talented , and just a tad crude . but just enough to be funny .
stopped in at sing sing to have a few drink and hang out with some friend . the entertainment wa fun . the guy do a great job singing , playing the instrument , and keeping the crowd pleased . sing sing is attached to the rock bottom brewery so they have house beer . i did have the sampler and i enjoyed all six beer i sampled . what a great place to hang out . i highly recommend .
what a fun place ! ! : ) the 2 guy playing piano and telling joke are great ! we went there for drink on weekend and the place had a good crowd . it is definitely entertaining and fun . not family friendly though !
sing sing is a great place to change up the pace on a saturday night ! we had a large part of 22 people so my sister took care of the reservation , but by the look of it , it seemed like every table wa reserved ! my suggestion is that you call ahead and reserve a table for however large your party is . do not forget it is $ 7 to get in unless it is your birthday it is free for you ! if you eat at rock bottom it is $ 3.50 for you to get in ! this is a dueling piano bar and it definitely a great time ! the musician are very talented and can play the drum , piano , and harmonica . well that is what it wa this night ! they played all different kind of genre ! no complaint about their musical talent for sure ! the only downfall is that they could be very vulgar towards the crowd , but it is all in good fun ! that crude humor did not bother u at all ! the service of wa fantastic l ! our server had to deal with 22 of u and did not miss a beat at all ! so you ask why 3 star , well 3 star because of the price of alcohol ! ! that wa a bit ridiculous , but at that moment when your a little tipsy it doe not seem to phase you until the next day ! it wa over $ 9 for a vodka tonic ! ! ! ahhhhh what kind of highway robbery is that ? ! ? ? but all in all it a great change of pace ! we would do it again , but definitely not drink a much the best time !
service wa terrible from the time we walked in , very overcrowded , and overrated , doe not live up to the hype in the least bit .
i brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper . the damage wa minimal , but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting . the staff were very helpful in explaining my option and presenting me with a few choice to get the most bang for my buck . they completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job . a few week later , i noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question . i would definitely recommend these guy if you need bodywork or paint work done .
i wa so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop , from the very first time i took my car in for an estimate to a couple month down the line when i got my car repaired ( they still remembered me ! ) . one thing i really like is that they always pick up the phone . you would not believe how annoying it is when business do not do this during normal business hour . they are so personable and gave me an honest quote that i could not turn down because it wa the lowest in town ( i checked out 5 place ) . they just really made this process painless and smooth . i believe it is a family-run business , and boy doe it show in their hospitality.fran and jason were the one that i worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient , especially with a customer like me who want to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculation are accurate . joe diiorio is ( with an `` i '' not an `` l '' ) auto body also work closely with enterprise car rental down the street , so they came and picked me up . those guy down there have a great relationship with this body shop a well and were really accommodating.overall , the quality of their work is amazing . i had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light ( they ended up getting an oem light instead of the aftermarket one because it did not match ) and get a brand new bumper . they blended the paint for me , washed , waxed , and vacuumed my car , and their work ha a lifetime guarantee . what can i say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other yelpers can find this helpful , a this is how i found out about them .
from my first phone call to joe diliorio is , i wa impressed . every staff member i spoke too wa kind and eager to help . i wa treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repair from a low speed collision . i wa able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage . joe dilorio is took care of everything from that point on . they dealt directly with my insurance company , ordered the part ( even getting new part instead of the used one my insurance company wrote the estimate for , at no cost to me ) , and gave me a call when all the part came in . i then brought my car back to them and they completed the repair in a timely fashion . when i arrived to pick up my vehicle , i wa pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed , washed , and waxed my car ! most importantly , the repair work wa absolutely top notch . they masterfully blended the paint to match older part with newer repair part . my car look even better than before the wreck ! if you do not want any hassle , want to be treated with respect , and want your car looking fantastic , give these guy a call ! -adam
joe dilorio is auto body shop wa so helpful when i needed to get window replaced . the were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shop in the area . they were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with . i am planning on taking my car here for all future auto need .
this is the best place we have ever taken our car to . their customer service is outstanding . it appears that they really like doing what they do because they are always willing to explain everything in detail . i also like that they do not over charge . i completely trust them to be honest and do the best job possible .
this place is amazing ! i needed my car repaired after an accident and the guy here were so helpful . they set me up with a rental car a soon a i dropped my car off , repaired my car in a timely manner , detailed it for free , and their customer service wa unbelievable ! ! ! i can not recommend this place more !
i am grateful to my insurance company for recommending di iorio is auto body shop . after an accident , i needed some body work done a soon a possible . the other recommended shop would not even make an appointment to see me for day . these guy fit me in that afternoon , and coordinated the rental too . everyone i worked with wa courteous and pleasant , and the work wa done more quickly than expected . moreover , they found way to help save on the expense . the car came out looking better than before the accident -- a few day later , i noticed they had buffed out some scratch that were not even part of the repair area . i will definitely be back next time i need auto repair .
i had a good experience with this body repair shop several year ago , so took my car back again recently . this time wa a lot different - the repair took longer than promised , and wa not done a well a i expected it to be . i guess they are no longer interested in repeat customer .
so lucky to be referred to joe diiorio is after moving to pittsburgh . i have been taking my car here since 2011 and i recommend them to everyone . it is really invaluable to have `` car guy '' that you trust . i could detail many experience here ( in comparison to other chain shop ) , but suffice it to say that they have always been honest , helpful , and fair .
you can find pretty good body work without too much trouble . finding a place that is friendly , prompt , and organized that also doe good body work is more difficult . joe dilorio is delivers on all count . highly recommended for the next time you -- or somebody else -- make a little mistake on the road .
amazing repair service . i hit a really fat raccoon in the appalachian ( it wa dark and rainy and i did not see the poor thing until it wa too late ) while going fairly fast down a hill . the raccoon destroyed my front bumper , the grill , and my right fog light . thankfully i had duct tape in my trunk . anyway , once i got back to pittsburgh , i called my insurance agent.my insurance referred me to diiorios and i am really glad they did ! the staff wa very friendly and helpful doing the estimate . they even set up a rental for me when i wa having the car repaired . they kept me updated on the status of the car and were just really pleasant to work with the whole time.hopefully i do not have to get any body work done on my car again anytime soon , but if i do , i know i am going to take back to diiorios .
i did not like the customer service of this body shop.. there price estimate for my repair wa outrageous.. they will not be getting my business
i have gotten a few more estimate since i wrote my original review.. i found that joe dilorio is repair estimate wa three time the price of the other auto body shops.. if you do not believe me= check yourself..
good sevice everytime my bmw is there . look like it came off the show room floor after it fixed from a collision everytime .
typical , but new . you see all of the people that are walking in and out and , i must say , the customer look like they work for a living hear . i swear one of the guy wa covered head to toe in soot . that is amazing . ran around the store looking for those few item that i needed to satisfy my need to build and create . minimal help from the small quantity of employee , but some of them actually asked if i needed help -- after i had found the item .
when making a customer is paymento atlowe is , we have our checklist:1 . do the phone number match ? nope , but that is fine since people are always changing their phone number anyways.2 . doe the name on account match name on check ? nope , but mistake happen at those pesky check companies.3 . doe the account number on the check match the account number on the screen ? why should it , those computer are always making mistakes.now that we have verified that all the information is correct , we can process the payment . the customer will be so happy that we did not have to bother them with any silly question . ******i am sad to say that this is an actual occurrence . what wa originally an average lowe is ha turned into lowe is hell . if the associate do not have basic logic comprehension , how do they survive ?
your typical area big box hardware store . it is convenient to go to because of the proximity to other store and how close it is to so many communities.ca not really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lane it is a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate .
this local lowe is serf it purpose for my husband and me -- a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two . i am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store . i am not sure how it compare to other lowe is store , but when shopping at the home depot in north fayette last fall , their flower selection wa dismal compared to this lowe is .
waterfront lowe is beat monroeville lowe is for lawn and garden . hate to admit it , but it is true .
my husband and i went to the store on june 29th . we planned to purchase two door . we decided to pay $ 35.00 to have an installer come to the house and measure so that lowes can install the door . we would be paying several hundred dollar to get the door installed . after the installation , lowe is would refund u the $ 35.00 . our paperwork said we would receive a call from an installer within 2 business day . i also had a few other question that our salesman said the dept manager would call me about the next day . never received a call from anyone at lowe is ! by july 2 we still had not heard from the installer or the dept manager . i called the dept manager and asked him my few question that i had . he answered one question and said he would have another millwork person call me . millwork never called me ! by july 3 , i called our salesman ( david crane ) . he wa surprised that i had not heard from the installer . he told me he would send a message to the installation dept about calling us.today it is july 8th and we still have not heard a peep from anyone at lowes . our total order that we planned on spending at lowe is wa around $ 1700.00 ! ! i called today and asked to talk to a store manager . i told him that we have not heard from anyone at lowe is and that we are not going to proceed with our order . i told him we would like our $ 35.00 back . he said ok , just bring in your receipt the next time you are at the store . he never apologized , he never even asked me what my customer number wa so he could look up our order and maybe somehow save this sale ! ! ! ! i can not believe how unprofessional this store wa ! goodbye lowes ... hello home depot ! ! what a shame ! david crane our salesperson wa very nice and helpful to u ... too bad he is losing the sale .
lowe is is my goto store for home improvement supply . it is convenient and local to me . customer service is always great and price are fair . my most recent experience with customer service wa amazing . so a hose burst on my hot tub . call repair guy or try to fix it myself ? i gave it a go . took picture of the hose and fitting and headed to the plumbing section . i showed the gentleman the picture and asked for help . he did not have exactly the fitting for a hot tub , but gave me what he thought would work . it did ! under $ 3 buck later and all wa a go ! winter came and it sprung a leak in same spot . my fault and maybe lack of strength to tighten fitting and frigid temp . back to plumbing section . same gentleman . gave me the advice again and bam , fixed ! this is what i want in customer service . sadly , i can not remember his name . ( bad customer on my part . ) thank you ! ! !
lowe is is my first stop for all of my home project . i am currently redoing door . lowe is ha knowledgeable employee that offer advice to the diys a well a a stable of contractor to hire out the big job . return are handled seamlessly , who doe not grab the wrong part ? their garden section is great for spring planting . they have competatively priced appliance . 5 % off with lowe is credit card is also nice . having those large item delivered is a convenience . their best asset is the expertise of the staff . i frequently change mind on an original concept based on their input . highly recommended
i went into lowes for a few item -- one being a dehumidifier . i asked 2 different employee to assist -- they were rude and told me to read the box . being 8 month pregnant i could not lift the box into the cart and they did not much care . finally after asking another 3 employee -- i found one to help . so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other item . clearly there are zero expectation for customer service here .
i stopped in because i needed to buy some damprid for my bathroom . i wa in the waterfront doing some other shopping when i decided to just stop here . i asked a gentleman where i could locate this product and he stated in would be in one of two aisle . i am always impressed at home improvement store how the employee know exactly where every product is.. no matter how small or popular . i went into the first aisle mentioned with no luck then onto the next one . i still didnt have luck and asked another employee who said i wa in the right aisle but the product wa located at the very end on the bottom shelf.while i wa satisfied with the customer service , it would have been easier and more friendly if one of those worker showed me where the product wa . i am always lost in these store . lowes competitor kind of go well beyond and show you exactly where product is.not a big deal , just explaining my 3 star review : ) the damprid wa sold in a 2 pack for under $ 6 . i left satisfied .
excellent wing and sandwich , generally good food otherwise , and fair price -- nice casual place . the service can be a little slow due to how popular the place get at peak time .
the food here can actually be a little hit and miss , but i love the grilled cheese club with fry . i get it way too much . people make fun of me.they have a ten dollar minimum for credit card , fyi .
3.5 rounding down . it been a while since jb and i ate here and i would consider going back but we just have not gotten around to it . the beer selection looked great but the first 3 beer that i wanted `` had not come in yet '' ( they were in the middle of expanding their offering , this really bother me ... if you do not have the product , do not put it on the menu ) .its not necessarily vegetarian friendly , i got a pizza and it wa good , not fantastic , only good . justin wa satisfied with his meal . it a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but i would not recommend going out of your way .
great atmosphere and even better people -- -- wait staff wa very friendly and the french onion soup wa amazing ... .definetly recommend the home made chip ... great bar in the up and coming homestead area ... ..highly recommend
we are always looking for non-chain restaurant by the waterfront ( they do exist ... ) , and this ha become a favorite . i have had the hot roast beef & fry and the corned beef on rye , and both were delicious . every beer i have had here ha been ice cold , and the service ha been strong too . it is a great place to watch a pirate game too .
stopped by on a mon evening after trying to dine at smoke taqueria which is closed monday . parking on street in front or behind off hay st. super friendly bartender . in warmer month they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area . okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection . tried the italian club which wa really good - two of u split one . also tried sweet potato fry - amazingly good ! home made chip w bleu were overpowered by sauce . bathroom wa in need of plaster and wall repair & wa grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level . bet it is a fun place in warmer month .
awesome wing and pubgrub ! great beer selection and fun bartender .
this place is overrated . a friend and i were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wing were terrible and the beer wa good but overpriced . there is nothing wrong with this place i just do not understand the clout around it . there should be no clout .
there is lot of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place , but the food wa average at best . we were there on a pen playoff night and there were 2 people working all the table in both room . our food came to u cold and unimpressive at that . our order were somewhat mixed up . the potato skin used a really cheap artificial cheese that wa not very appealing . i tasted a slice of pizza , which is definitely the best thing they offer . the crust wa delicious and homemade . if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza . we also ordered the chicken wing which were pretty good , also . if you are looking for good food , homestead better choice at blue dust or tin front .
before today i probably would have given this place three star based mostly on their beer selection ; however , today the service wa terrible . we waited two hour for a pizza sub , french onion soup , fry , and buffalo chicken tender . about an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tender ( ie , no hot sauce ) . we were told by the waitress that she realized it wa wrong , but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it . she sent it back . by a half hour later , we still had not received the buffalo chicken tender , nor the french onion soup ( which should have been mostly made already ) , and no fry . we were told the chef wa new , but no effort wa made really to make the situation better . no quick and easy app or beer on the house . to boot , the beer wa pretty expensive . i will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection , but it will not be for a while . the food ha always been average at best , and the pizza sub wa no different . we ended up leaving after two hour without receiving 75 % of our order .
i am reading on here that the food is really hit or miss . i have only gone to duke is one time , but the food wa good . it wa not too busy so our service wa very attentive and it did not take long to get our food at all.the place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area . we sat in the dining area because the bar area wa pretty full . the dining room area definitely fill up with an older , have lived in pittsburgh all their life crowd , while the younger crowd is in the bar area . i will definitely be back since i live in the area .
duke ... the owner ... is the man . he is a true pittsburgher and he love everyone from pittsburgh . he look like he will beat you up but he is a softy with a big heart . look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friend ... he will hook you up . he is also totally into the development of other pittsburgh business and he host event for local startup . ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next door ... i believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sort . fortunately , the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it is just far enough out of the ghetto ... the crowd is certainly decent . definitely have some beer on the porch in the summer ... especially in the rain ( lower level is covered ) . very relaxing atmosphere . i wish my company wa located in the area so we could frequent duke more steadily ( we are on the north side ) . still worth the drive to feel at home , have a good bite and some cold beer .
i have been to duke is three time now . when i first came to pgh , a lot of local were telling me that this wa a good place to catch a game , drink some brew and get great food . most of that is true , but the bad ha mostly outweighed the good.they have an excellent new tap system . last time i went , they had thirsty dog leghumpper on draft , and it wa perfect . the system really elevates already awesome beer . plus , the selection is awesome . it is a sports-themed bar , so you can expect drunk local , loud tv is and plenty of yelling . i am sort of into that , so it doe not bother me , although i do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos . service is often slow , and they give the waitress zero training in the beer that they offer . this is not a good place for trying something new , a they can not tell you a thing about it . the biggest downfall of duke is , though , is the food . i have had three different , but equally simple , dish there ; a burger , a cheesesteak and chicken tender . the first wa flavorless and cold . the second wa passable , but nothing special . and the last were absolutely awful . honestly , the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill , i had to call it an early night . i ate two of the 7 tender ( seven ! ) and had to quit . their fry are very good . and so are the wings.i 'd say duke is is a good place to drink , but that is about it .
food is good here . great beer selection on tap . sometimes the beer is on the pricey side . what i want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special . pinkerton is one of the best sandwich . good place to watch football , hockey , baseball .
one of my favorite local eatery . the mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite , i wish i could purchase it . i am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fathead sandwich . food portion is great . the only complaint i would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side , a usual in most local bar . friendly service , will continue to frequent with my family .
came back tonight after a hiatus and missing out on getting food from the franktuary truck at voodoo homestead . i wa going to get a burger until i saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on saturday evening . for $ 19 you got a large cut of meat , which wa pretty tasty , a large side salad , and i chose a loaded baked potato for the side . they were a little chintzy with the side . the prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus . i asked for a horseradish sauce , which they had , but the container wa so small i had to ask for another . it wa a similar situation with the large side salad . it wa pretty big , and required at least a second side of dressing . the food wa all pretty good , with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear . a always , the beer selection wa pretty solid and i really enjoyed my east end brewery monkey boy .
we recently ordered fish sandwich from here . they were huge ! we did get the large , but it wa so big we could have just shared one . wa not over fried . the french fry were hot and also very good . we will definitely be going again to try something different .
if you want to know the people from homestead/munhall then duke is the place for you . a local favorite they have seen a lot of growth since i started going 10 year ago . they have a great selection of beer but i think where they really shine is in the food department . my favorite sandwich there is the pinkerton and it is often hard to get anything else every time i go . pierogi pizza is pretty good a well a there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together ! duke is also an awesome place to watch sporting event with their see it from any angle tv selection all around the bar . soup of the day are awesome ( potato soup yes please ) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollar . i have always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and i do not have any complaint .
went to duke last week . they have really renovated the place , and added a lot of large screen tv is . the best part , tho , is the vast improvement in draft beer selection . i counted 46 beer on tap . if you are a beer head and are at the waterfront shopping are , this is definitely one of your best choice . the food is above average , and the selection is common pub fare .
i find it frustrating to read bad review about great bar and restaurant that are based on almost nothing . i eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great . i have eaten here around 50 time and never had a bad meal . great draft and great service . this is the best bar in this area .
i went to duke is upper deck cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit . i went there to watch an elite 8 game , and felt a little out of place a i wa the only person in the bar that did not seem to know everyone who wa there . however , that quickly went away because the regular and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable ( i wa cheering for my alma-matter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if i wa loud ) . the drink were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer option . the food wa just ok . i ordered the wing , which were very good in a unique way . the sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wing come submerged in it . initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them i can see why people love them , messy but delicious . i also ordered the pita pizza , i would not recommend this a it just wa not very good . i am looking forward to returning to duke is this summer when i can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wing .
the chili dog rock ! the portion are huge so come hungry . big selection of appetizer that go beyond the standard bar food list . great selection of draft beer . noise level is good for lunch but may be loud for dinner .
love duke and love the food . i wish i could figure out the closing time or i wouldnt plan so many after work gathering . their food is amazing never had a bad meal and their price are standard for craft and actually pretty cheap for domestic
i really do not see how anyone could give this place a bad review . the food is fantastic and if it is not my belly luring me in then it is the awesome beer selection they have . my suggestion for those who are leery to try duke after reading other ridiculous review is just order what they have on special that night ... everything is good so you can not go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it is on special . if not i could suggest other delicious thing to eat but i do not feel like typing out the entire menu ... they often switch the beer out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beer on tap ... they can also print you out a list of beer and their percentage so you know what you are in for ! ( lol ) anyhow i love this place , the owner , and the staff ! i highly suggest it to everyone who like good beer and good food !
my boy and i stopped here for dinner one night . it wa cold and dreary outside but warm and homey in here . our server wa extremely nice . the menu had lot of option . they are kind of known for their potato soup so that is what i had . it is very good . it is a very thick soup that is velvety smooth . i would definitely order it again . it wa perfect for a rainy night . my youngest son had chicken tender . they looked a little over cooked but i tasted one and it wa good . the coating wa crispy and the chicken wa juicy . my older son ordered wing with their house made sauce . it wa good but not spicy enough for him . i thought it wa good and would order it the next time i go .
had corned beef sandwich . meh . onion ring were horrible . extremely breaded and doughy . greasy a all get out . i hope the chef will take the hint when all of the breading come back , a i had to peel it away to get to the onion .
what a cool place in homestead . love the environment and the food wa really good . stop here then head to the waterfront to see a movie . it will be a great night .
thank god for the draft list is all i can say . 3 thing that were ordered were all wrong . asked for no onion on all 3 and they all had onion on them . the place wa not busy at all so if it wa i could understand . the burger wa solid though , steak on the salad wa ice cold even though we were asked how we wanted it cooked so i assumed it wa cooked to order and would come out at least warm . the inside of the place wa clean and neatly decorated so that is a positive . really loud place inside . i 'd come here for the awesome draft selection but might pas on the food .
cool place to hangout . good food , good price and selection on beer and solid service . geographically not in the most convenient of location though , so that is why it is getting 4 , not 5-stars . would recommend going here .
stopped for late lunch yesterday ( 3/4/16 ) . extensive draft beer selection , by which i wa pleasantly surprised ( many neighborhood pub in pittsburgh , it is bud light , yuengling or nothing , it seems ) . food menu is large and pretty typical pub fare , burger , sandwich , pizza , etc . ordered the tuna melt special , which wa nothing spectacular , but tasty enough . pleasant atmosphere and bartender wa very friendly . would like to go back when the weather is better and the back deck is open . overall , a good local alternative to all the chain place down in the waterfront .
the transformation of this place is beyond amazing . if you have not been there in a while you owe it to yourself to check it out . clean and consistent . friendly and fresh . hand down our favorite place to eat in the area .
2 strike . enjoy the fact that there are other option in the area like duke but our last couple visit have been very disappointing . hate to do it but i need to leave a review in hope the manager can get thing right . one of the main issue is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food i have ordered the past 2 visit . i can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that come out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost . last visit wa a burger . i gave up and refused the offer for another . bartender were super cool about it and even offered me free drink token which i decided to redeem today . i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich . it wa the roast beef and turkey club which wa described specifically on the menu a medium rare which sounded pretty good to me . the roast beef wa beyond that . i would say extra well done . obviously one of the chef is struggling but i am not totally sure that the beef wa cooked in house . i am not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp . anyway i decided not to say anything since the sandwich wa still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining . decent beer selection . waitress wa very pleasant and attentive . bar staff not so much this visit . we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back . neither of u were not very happy about this . possibly a no standing policy since there wa only one empty chair at the bar ? at least say something/acknowledge the customer that ha been standing clearly in your view for 10 min obviously waiting for a drink .
duke is is one of pittsburgh is best kept secret in my opinion and one of my favorite spot to drink . the interior is really nice , the outdoor section is also really spacious and great for warm weather day . beer selection is great and the bartenders/waitstaff are always on their game . when i come with large group i find that the waitress are always very attentive and quick on their foot . if i had one minor complaint it would be with the food . some people might like it but when it come to appetizer i just find that they go wayyyy overboard with the greasiness/breading . i would highly recommend duke is to anyone who is looking to mix it up .
great place for a birthday party ! a family gathering ! a work retirement party ! or even a double-date ! a combination watering hole , great place to eat and great entertainment for adult ! adult game ! the homestead ( pittsburgh ) location of dave & buster is just one of the almost 50 location across the country - from new york to florida to california - - from canada to mexico . the dave & buster idea wa conceived in little rock , arkansas back in the 1970s . two different business ( one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business ) were right next door to each other . the two young owner were friend and quickly realized that combining their business made perfect sense . so they opened the first combined d & b in . . . . no , not little rock , but dallas ! to this day there are no d & b is in little rock . not sure what is up with that ! but lot of other city have been the beneficiary of these two friend combining their businesses.the one in pittsburgh is the only one i have ever been to . when i lived there , a group of friend and co-worker ( and me , of course ! ) used to go there for happy hour & power hour . . . . at least once a week . we had a blast ! a great place to kick-back and let the worry of the work day melt away.wonder if they will ever open one in marin county , can ? shuck ! probably not . not a marin county scene , for sure . what a blast it wa though ! i miss going to d & b . they have all the classic , like billiards & shuffleboard , plus over 200 interactive & video game . a rechargable power card provides an easy way to access all the game . power hour is game happy hour - - an entire hour of classic and video game for just ten buck . a great bar , wonderful food and service ! a relaxing and fun way to spend a friday or saturday evening . you will never want to leave . meet your friend here , grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the game . time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl , your best friend or even your bos ! dave & buster ! lot of parking ! lot of fun ! fun ! fun ! fun ! fun ! fun ! fun ! . . . . bring on the beer !
d & b is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy . they are also really clever about designing the psychological context in way to extract money from their customer . you feel a bit milked afterwards . also much fatter.you pay for game using credit from mag-stripe card . this let d & b give their game arbitrary price and make it harder for you to really know how much you are spending . menu for drink and food have no price . $ 6.05 for a banana split cocktail ? $ 3.40 for a michelob ? i have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the price is clever because they can price their thing and not have to obey pricing psychology ( like anchor and so forth ) .waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order dessert . oh , and the dining room ha plastic demo dessert tray to get that thought going in your mind a you walk to your table.the game are all violent shooter or racing game do not appear to have changed much since 2002 when i last went to d & b in california . hope they can find more innovative arcade game in the future.not a pleasant experience , but at least it is different from going to an ordinary restaurant .
this wa actually the first time i have ever been to a dave and buster's.walking into such a huge space , especially coming from the often narrow venue in san francisco wa strange.un-nerving actually . because dave and buster is is all about excess . almost obscenely so.as far a food - their stuff is standard . most of it is fried and a another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy . at all actually . you have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.but most people do not come to dave & buster is for food . they come for the games.and while i have never been that into video game or arcade game - my brother and sister always have . i wa apprehensive about having a good time here - but after awhile - my sibling ' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and i found myself really enjoying myself.especially once i realized that i have mad skill at skee ball . and proceeded to dominate.trust .
think chuck e. cheese for adult . skee ball , video game pool table . clean environment . good fun.unfortunately , i went for a bite to eat and it wa impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu . i ended up settling for spinach dip . sadly , they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few second . blahhhh . trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad . i swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle . i could barely eat the salad . too sweet.my mom ordered a steak roll ... ..holy friedness ! the steak wa more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that wa fried again ! yowzer ! artery clogger for sure . i like the atmosphere . i like the bar area . perhaps next time we will just stop by for drink instead .
i love the game here but can not go very often since they do not rotate new game in very often . the place is usually pretty clean.pool table often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better one you will find in the city.food is just `` ok '' drink price are fair but not great .
dave and buster is is an enigma , is it dining , a bar , or playground for video game lover ? let me get the bar part out of the way first , it is overpriced , and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill . next , the food . just like all the chain place at the waterfront , there are sandwich , burger ( yes they have a blue cheese burger , who doe not ? ) pasta , salad , chicken finger , yadda yadda . the game , i swear over three quarter of the game have been there since 2000 when the place opened . i guess in ten year no new game have hit the scene.overall dave and buster is is unique to the waterfront , but it is time to update the menu , update the game , and get into the second decade of the 21st century .
because i have significantly younger sister , i go to dave and buster about twice a year . it is fun for them and nostalgic for me . it can get expensive and the 'prizes ' are cheap but it make for great `` sister day '' a for the food , we have eaten there once and never again . it is just blah ... frozen and fried . the veggie burger wa put on there a an afterthought just so they could say they offer it . a frozen boca patty thrown on a bun . thanks ! i could have ran to costco for that . drink are rather expensive but that is to be expected . so go for the game , fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drink and a bite to eat ( skip the bountiful chain that span the waterfront and try blue dust on amity street ) .
the food wa absolutely gross ! i ordered a turkey club which come on a wheat bun with avocado , bacon , and turkey breast . what i got wa totally different from the picture ! first of all the sandwich wa on sliced bread ( lame ) ! there wa no avocado , 1 slice of bacon , no lettuce , and to top it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking lunch meat ! lol no , not the kind that you get from the deli , the other sweaty nasty looking stuff ! gross ! our waitress wa awful but they were extremely understaffed so i would have a bit of an attitude if i had to wait 10 table without assistance too . the manager wa really nice ... of course that disgusting sandwich that i did not eat wa free .
the usual fun center.you can play game using a play card which you purchase there . game price can be confusing- - - 2.3 , 5.7 , 9.9 credit , etc.the arcade can be fun if you bring some friend . almost every game is a ticket game and there are few innovative or exciting game choices.i did not eat there , so i can not rate the restaurant part of dave and buster .
we came here on a saturday night and luckily it wa not a packed a i thought it would be . i love playing ticket game so luckily there were a lot of game to chose from and not many video game ( sorry video game lover ! ) we only played $ 20 worth of game and surprisingly we were there for awhile . i love their new wheel of fortune game ! on our first play , we ended up winning a little over 700 ticket ! they also have fruit ninja a a game . it wa fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you do not win a many ticket a you would hope . i wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counter like the other d & b is i have been to , where you feed a counting machine your ticket . at this place , they just weigh your ticket and give you the final count . we did not try the food here and instead went to p.f . chang is to eat before coming here , but the eat & play deal looked fun . too bad it wa only restricted to certain time of the day . overall i had a blast here and definitely would come back . hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion .
a table for 16 please ... that is what i had to ask for and knew that d & b could accomodate.i happen to be in the homestead area for work . i really wanted to dig into my yelp bag of trick provided by local yelpers and introduce my team to the `` shock and awe '' they deserved but ... the shear number would made it hard.when i started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - the only idea i could come up with wa the golden corral - i knew that wa not going to work for me.we decided to do something local and walking distance - d & b wa it.it is what you expect - quiet for lunch video game and a bar nearby but i had to forgo any festivity - it wa a work lunch . i wa pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu . i am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pant being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of family guy.the waitress wa very friendly and organized . i ordered the cabo style chicken - chicken breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled , topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.it wa eh ... the chicken wa cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo wa bland . the rice wa bland . the vegetable were cold . i really blame it on the fact i wa with 15 compatriot for lunch so i am giving it a fair rating . everything wa edible.my team went with deep fried food and burger . they seemed pleased.service - very goodfood - okay , not great . my meal wa $ 13ambiance - well it wa clean but there were not really any people in d & bthere are so many other choice for lunch that are local and close . i would definitely recommend another in squirrel hill - i suggest you use yelp to find you a better one ( then come back and play ! ; - ) )
not much of a review for this one , but just a few tidbit of info ... pool ( on friday/saturday ) is $ 14 per hour ( i am pretty sure it $ 10 through the week ) mixed drink are way too pricey for the location.the food is crap.the game are fun and the pool table are nice ( they are the big tournament style/size , not the shitty bar-room , tiny pool table ) .that is all . : ) ( the pricing is based on my recent trip.we shot pool for a few hour , i had a bar tab ( that wa not out of control ) and my night ended up costing me $ 60
i love dave and buster ! ! it is a great place to go when you are wanting to have a great time with a great group of friend . if you find you and your friend bored on a friday or saturday night , come to d & b and win some prize ! ! it is pricey though , so bring some major moolah
dave and buster is the best place to eat and play game . there is many fun game and prize to win . i highly suggest if you want to play game , go wednesday when all the game are half off . food is pretty good and a nice bar . the downside is that the booze is pretty pricey .
when did dave and buster is become a daycare ? ? everywhere you look , there are sign that say kid must be accompanied by an adult , but apparently no one wa honoring that at 6pm on a saturday . i could not even walk through the place without someone shoving me . ahhh ! i get that dave and buster is is an arcade and that you are going there to play some game , maybe eat , and kill some time . when i last went there a few year ago , we there for my bachelor party , and while i am sure we got into some shenanigan , i do not remember child running wild there . we were having adult beverage , playing game , and having a good time . this time , it wa ridiculous . it is not chuck e. cheese , yet that is how parent seem to be treating the place.on top of that , the customer service sucked . the place is gigantic , with table and serving area everywhere , yet on a saturday at 6pm , the hostess told u ( after interrupting u three time to chat with the other hostess ) told u it would be a three hour wait , despite the fact that there were empty table all over the dining room . i suspect this is a ploy to get you to play game and spend money until you are table is ready , but the food at dave and buster is is not worth a three hour wait on any day.the hostess told u we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table , so we attempted that . most of those table were empty with usually one or two adult at a giant empty table filled with coat who informed u that they needed the table because their kid would be back soon after playing game . next , i engaged in the most rudest thing i have ever done- i began stalking table where people were finishing up . i would walk up to people paying their check , ask if i could have their table when they were done , and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and i should get in line.finally , we found a table and proceeded to spend two hour eating dinner . it wa not because we ordered a lot of food- it wa that the waiter took forever to bring our food out . he seemed to have no problem getting u fresh drink , until we drank a much a we could and then asked for water . after that , he seemed to come around a lot le . i had the build your own chicken taco , which come on a giant plate with all kind of fixing . the fixing were fresh , but the chicken wa cold and dry , and the tortilla were dried out a well . for $ 14 , it wa not worth it . after dinner we proceeded to play game , which entail shoving people to get through area and waiting in line to play anything . all in all , i did not like my experience at dave and buster . i remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind a an adult . but between all the kid and the crappy service , can not recommend this place . if anyone asks me to go back , i may elect to stay home and poke my eye with a fork .
not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here . but it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out . i ate dinner here and the food wa great i also played pool and the arcade game .
my friend and i both had friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on thursday night . we settled on dave and buster . i went on facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $ 20 get $ 20 in play free ( we split the card , it took u about 1.5-2 hour to get through ) the game were not *quite* a fun a i remembered , but it wa still a good time . the place wa far from crowded , and when a machine wa out of ticket , it took u a good deal of time to find someone to assist u . when we did , the team at d & b could not have been more accommodating . to apologize for our wait they swiped u in for several game a well a gave u a handful of token for the game we were playing . i think a lot of company ( i am looking at you , american airline ) could learn a lot from d & b . it cost them virtually nothing to swipe u in for game , but it made our experience so much better.drinks are half-price after 8 or 9 , my tropical mojito wa awesome ! my friend and i are definitely planning on going back on a wednesday for half-price game and half-price drink .
dave and buster is ha to be split up into separate experience to rate it . dining : 2 starsi had a party of 20 coming in ; i had called ahead of time , and arrived early . they immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friend and i waited ; the hostess , after taking my name , never spoke to u again . she did not tell u when we could sit , how long it would be , or any other information . and then they made u wait for 75 % of our party to show up before they would seat u . mind you , there wa no one else waiting , and the table wa ready , and we were ready to order . but they did not tell u this ; i did not even know why we were being forced to wait until i heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making u wait . i still have no idea why we were forced to wait . when my full party wa finally seated , we were helped by two waiter who were perfectly polite and nice . but , our service wa rather haphazard . people would order drink and food , and get thing at wildly different time . one person wa done eating appetizer and drink when another wa just getting their first drink . i know there wa chaos to a big party , but it got a little out of hand.the food is pretty standard american chain food , comparable to appleby is and chili is - not offensive , but nothing to knock your sock off . it ha a decent selection , and a few good dessert and appetizer , and everything wa competently prepared . overall , it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable price , but some of the service standard are poor . in the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurant in the area and then move over to d & b is for games.bar : 1 stardrinks are predictably expensive , but there is a wide variety . the problem is that about half of them do not even kind of resemble what is on the menu , and most do not have enough alcohol to even taste . worse yet , while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade , the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude . you have to track them down , and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.arcade : 4 starsthere are a lot of great game here to play , and many that are fun with group or pair . it is a great place for a large party , because you can mingle with all your friend playing many different very fun game . if you are a couple , there are also many great selection that everyone enjoys . the staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix game that have problem , and are typically polite . the ticket prize are cheap a expected , but kind of fun , and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.overall : 3 starsif you want to hang out here , i would suggest eating somewhere else , and then playing game and having fun here , but only order beer at the bar and do not expect a smile .
chuckie cheese for grown ups ... yeah , that could sum up my review for sure ( but i will try to make it a bit more interesting than that ) .first let me say that this is not my first trip to a dave & buster is . second , i actually experience all of it while here . we will start with the food/service . staff , you were wonderful . you were polite , you greeted u a soon a we walked in the door , gave u no qualm while ordering and were swift with your delivery . food , you were not wonderful . i ordered the bbq chicken breast . this came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potato . the chicken wa a bit dry and in some place you can tell it wa left on the grill a little too long . there were actually some bite that all i could taste wa charred meat . there wa not enough bbq sauce on the the chicken either . the broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared . some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp area on it . also i noticed that there were still some leaf left on the broccoli . the mashed potato i wanted to like ( which i hoped would be the best part of the dish , i am a bit of a potato freak ) , but ala , i wa let down . *sad face* they were cold and such a tiny portion . with a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it is container . oh food , how if i did not need you to survive , i would not complain about you.the building right now is in disarray . they are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtain covering up certain section of their dining area . no bar out in the dining area right now and the pool table were absent a well . if you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.speaking of the game room , by far the best part . with the meal i ordered i got the $ 20 play card ( the best part of the meal , super charge it for $ 3 more and it is even better ) . the game room you can tell is in need of an update . the carpet is worn and other sign of wear are noticeable a well . one good thing is the game . they change them up so often that there is always something new once you return . who knew that playing connect 4 could be so fun , or for that matter skee ball rise to the top of my list to play.i will return again , but only after i eat elsewhere first .
not really sure what to add . so i will bullet point my experience.- expensive poorly made drinks- friendly but slow service- ok food considering ( had the philly steak and cheese ) - over run with kid before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision- 15 % of the game were out of order ( air hockey , big bball game , 1/2 of the skee ball , random other arcade machine ) - expensive games- fun time overall with the wife .
mediocre service . cold food ! our food waited so long the lettuce & pickle wilted . bland food . crazy overpriced . long wait in the arcade . 1 beer per hour maximum . avoid at all cost . fair manager .
not being from the area , i traveled an hour to come here from uniontown , pa . i wa excited ! i have not been to this dave and buster is since i wa younger and wa ready to go back and play me some game ! i went with my cousin , mind you , we had not ate all day and were very hungry . so , we decided to do the eat & play combo , naturally . here is where it get bad . first of all , we get a very snobby hostess that show u to our table . then , we wait ... and wait ... and finally after about 25 min we get a waitress . her name wa ashley . we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted , so we quickly put our order in . next , we were sitting and talking , waiting , we had empty glass and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refill except for one time . she said she 'd come back right away with our refill ... yea , right . 20 min later we get our refill . mind you , our food still ha not came yet . i see other people getting their food that had come in after u . i wa frustrated . after waiting 45 min for our food , i asked to speak with a manager . one of the server who i asked replied rudely with `` well , he is really busy right now . i doubt he will be able to come out and talk to you '' . finally , 15 min later ... that is one hour , folk . we get our food . what do you think the next problem wa ? yep , the food wa cold . i wa completely fed up at this point , and told my waitress how disappointed i wa , especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service . the manager never came to speak with me , and we did not even receive our meal for free . the only compensation we got were $ 10 game card . woopty-doo . the only thing good about this place is the game , but the prize you get for your ticket are all junk and worthless . so , in conclusion ... i do not recommend the waterfront dave and buster of homestead , pa . it wa horrible , and i will not be returning for a very long time !
this place just plain sucksbad management lost them bizdumb arcade drama** they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 year old
first time at dave & buster is and although i did not go for the game , i wa slightly disappointed . i went with a group of girl for dinner and drink . the service wa slow but the food wa decent . the portion were huge but they are priced slightly higher than the average chain . we went before 9 pm and there were a ton of kid there on a friday night . i do suggest if you want to avoid the child to go after 9 .
dave & buster ! it is a nice place to eat , have fun and drink ! ! all age can enjoy this place . i wa so excited to hear them announce that after 10p , all child whether accompanied by a guardian or not had to go ! it made for a nice evening for adult only . everytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves . i did not give it four star because every time i have went i have not been able to eat in the restaurant area of there . i know i still get the same food that everyone else doe wherever you sit . sometimes , i like the nice relaxing atmosphere of the restaurant . i have not a of yet , been seated there . not to mention that the server around the bar , are a little slow at responding to customer a well . so all in all , d & b is is a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment . just do not expect to be seated in the restaurant portion , and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area .
wa impressed by the new menu and new decor . our waitress wa nice , knowledgeable and attentive . however , the rest of the staff wa le than stellar . there wa a power outage ( le than one minute ) while we were paying game ( sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened ) . my family and i were playing a trivia game -- -we lost about ten dollar of credit and all our bonus ticket when the power resumed . the game were down for about 20 min after the outage and staff wa not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the game would be working again . after the outage , two people in our group could not get their power card to work . when we asked staff for assistance they just brushed u off and said we must have been out of credit . kinda a bummer we lost so much money on ( malfunction ) game play tonight .
visiting from toronto , i wa really impressed ! the amount of ticket to be won wa incredible . we usually got 200 ticket per play on average . compared to playdium here , that is awesome considering i 'd win at most 10 ticket with the smallest prize costing 100 ticket . the food is great , the place is clean and the game do not feel greasy or nasty from all the food .
a fun place and lot to do but a bit pricy . $ 20.00 will buy you a hundred point which will last you a little over an hour.i recommend the bowling game , ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several game that can be played in group of 4
visited the dave and buster in homestead , pa last night . waitress mixed up our credit card and gave my brother credit card to someone else and he theirs . charged them already too - both incorrectly my brother had to walk around and find out who it wa . waitress never apologized . gm wa extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out . did nothing to remedy the situation and ignored u the rest of our visit - not even a refill . after spending over $ 300 plus game , we will never go back . whatever happened to the customer is always right ? horrible service
my boyfriend and i are in our 20 , and have visited this d & b multiple time . after our visit yesterday , however , i do not think we will be back . when we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game card . at first there were 2 extremely slow worker trying to do this , then one left while the line wa still out the door ! the girl that wa left wa more than incompetent , and wa taking extremely long to fill these game card . we stood in line for over 20 minute before being told that there wa another attendant in the actual game room . needle to say , the line in the game room wa just a long , and they still only had one girl in the booth . it wa a saturday ! after we finally got our card we had to wait yet again to get a beer . 2 bartender on staff while the bar wa completely full . it took u almost an hour before we actually could start gaming . the floor were filthy with trash , and the bathroom : repulsive ! i had to use the restroom twice during our visit , and not only did both bathroom i used have no toilet paper in them , but there wa tp all over the floor , and the sink were le than cleanly . my boyfriend mentioned that the guy restroom wa no better , a it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser did not work . all i have to say is get your crap together . we could see a difference in the type of crowed that wa there on saturday compared to what it used to be , and i am i have no doubt it is due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness . for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekend . it is a shame how quickly this place ha gone down hill and we will not be returning anytime soon !
most of the game were out of order and i had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credit . apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed . will not be back .
ehh , 3.5 -- i can not rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visit . speaking of that , i have been here a few time , but never wrote a review for d & b . i am a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the game . however , there have been multiple instance where i swiped my game card & it took my credit , but no game began . there have also been time that i won and no ticket were released . i guess nothing is perfect but it doe happen atleast once a visit ( each scenerio ) it is hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price game , you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credit for skee ball ( hmph ! ) the food- it really isnt anything too fancy . i have had okay food , but super long wait time for a simple chicken finger & fry for example . it is your basic sandwich , salad , appetizer & a few pasta . i believe all sandwich & burger are around $ 10 & served with fry . you can get the eat & play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card . besides the game card deal , if you wanted to make d & b a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own . try it once i suppose . the brownie sundae that i devoured last night wa satisfying ( 2 brownie , 2 scoop of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup ; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberry . oh & whip cream ) drinks- pretty weak . we ordered 2 liquid maryjanes ( 2 each that is ) which are filled with multiple shot of alchy & did not really catch a buzz . oh welllll . they do have a happy hour from 5-7pm . i 'd go during that time for the best deal . i believe cocktail are half off & $ 3 off bottle of wine . i have never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol . the prizes- a others have noted , the prize are a little cheap for the amount of ticket they `` cost '' however , it is cool to leave with a d & b coffee mug , cup or shot glass . last night for 2500 ticket we decided on magnetic-style dart board ( 1,300 ? ) a coffee mug , a d & b glass ( our plastic one bit the dust ) & a d & b coffee travel mug.. i might be missing a few odds & ends.overall it is a fun time but can be pricey . it is best to head here wednesday for half price game or get the eat & play deal while dining . i can not lie though , i find myself smiling ear to ear a few time within those 3 hour ( woah , seemed longer than amount of time : d ) speaking of which , in that time-frame we played 250 credit ( cost= $ 40 ) but it wa half-price game .
dave & buster is a great experience if you set your expectation realistically and carefully choose when you attend.the main squeeze and i always 1 ) use a survey receipt for buy $ 10 get $ 10 in free gameplay or 2 ) attend on a wednesday during the day ( flexible work schedule ) . we 'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food . and we only drink cheap draft or drink cocktail during happy hour.your visit is largely determined by time of day , expectation and whether or not you eat their food . if you come on a friday night , the line will be long . you will pay $ 150 for the two of you to eat , drink and play for 3 hour and you will be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.the staff is really excellent ; any issue with a game not paying out ticket result in immediate help and extra ticket or a swipe for a different game from an employee . note the `` drink are weak '' review . also notice it wa people buying shot and ordering multiple drink per person . that is typical white trash behavior . bartender here are savvy ; they mirror the behavior of the guest . all of our drink have been consistently strong and well put together because we are courteous and tip well . i have witnessed bartender bypass tattooed , loud guest and address me and take my order first . this is rational , logical behavior . also note the `` prize center game suck '' comment . you are supposed to stack ticket over multiple visit and use them on a big prize . like life , delaying gratification net you bigger return . every other visit i have seen someone walk out with a video game system ( wii , xbox360 and even a few xbox one is ) . the thing about dave & buster is the crowd change depending on day of week and time of day . sunday afternoon it is all family and friday and saturday night it is all drunk 20 somethings . the atmosphere change and that is why the review are all over the place.this review is based on 8ish month of 1-3/monthly visit . most visit are 5 star , some are 4 stars.using survey receipt for buy ten get ten , avoiding wednesday , friday or saturday evening ( and sunday afternoon , family ) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply , you will have a great experience for $ 25-40/person.i really enjoy the staff too , they split the difference between fun and professional . special shout out to riley , gave u info on possibly hosting a party there .
i still love this place ! i spent my 36th birthday at d & b is and it wa a wise decision ! i had so much fun , and so did my guest ! i got a very attentive serving staff , and met up with many helpful server ! i believe that service ha improved , so i bumped this restuarant up to 4 star ! no five star yet , because i have still a of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it ! it is still worth the visit , and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price !
there is good food , but a great spot to enjoy a few drink & watch sport on the big screen . it is great for adult fun after 10pm . great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxed
my wife and i went here around 10pm on a saturday night . the food wa not spectacular , about the same quality that you 'd get at an applebee is or some place similar -- good but not great . my steak wa tough , but my wife enjoyed hers . staff wa relatively unorganized ( we ate at a table next to the bar ) , and had to wait awhile for a server . food wa prompt .
after having a few 'less than memorable ' trip to d & b in year past , my wife and i decided to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday . pgh happy hour is a facebook group of friend that like to check out new 'watering hole ' every thursday and it is run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job . anyway- pgh hh wa celebrating an anniversary and chose d & b for the location . the d & b staff set up the back 'pool room ' with complimentary , enormous spread of appetizer with dip and kept refilling them when they got low . our server , carla , wa very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the special and checking back often when our glass got to the half way point . the other server back there wa working equally a hard but i never got the chance to get her name . i had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never got the chance to give them any credit . i think d & b is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event .
ok ! let me tell you about my bad experience first . i went to d & b last night for a post wedding party - which , side note , is a great idea ! it wa around midnight and the bar wa not really populated . there were three bartender and only one wa actually making round to see if anyone needed anything . the two other bartender were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one wa sitting at . kind of counter productive if you ask me . i stood there for about 5 minute , which for a busy bar is fine but when i am the only one with my card out then , it just seems a little ridiculous . i made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away . i finally had to walk to them to get their attention . i wa standing right in front of them smiling and they did not ask if i need anything . i finally said , `` are you working ? '' and they gave each other a weird look . i felt like i wa the crazy one . i asked for a beer/got the beer.in between that time , the other bartender brought food over and set it down . she took a fry from the plate ( right in front of me ) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar . what the hell ! i felt like i wa in some grimy bar in out in the stick - not an established d & b . i wa just really turned off from that experience . the good is that d & b provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix thing up . i remember going here with my grandparent when i wa a kid and it wa the best treat ever ! we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hour playing game . this place hold some really good memory for me . it is a shame that my experience last night ha spoiled the high standard i held for it .
it fun , but much smaller than some of the others i have visited . it clean , staff is friendly and it a good way to waste time before a movie . they do have good food . get a 3 star because i get bored easily at this location .
i used to love d & b when it first opened in the waterfront , but it ha gone down hill over the year . the game are not a fun and do not give you a many ticket and the prize have gotten cheaper in quality . it take a whole heck of a lot of ticket for you to even get a pencil ! the atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest game and diverse group of people ! now , it is run down and many of the game are app related game ( fruit ninja ) and 3d experience ride . with such `` game '' , you can not even earn ticket and they take a lot of token ! last time i went , back in the winter , many of the game were broken , which made for a negative player experience . i would go to d & b to play some game again in the future , but it is no longer one of my favorite place to go due to the decline of fun game where you can earn ticket .
i wa here on 10/3 and i have to say this wa a horrible experience . me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple game afterwards . it took the waitress at least 10-15 minute to greet u and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again . we ordered and got our drink and well let is just say we did not see the waitress again until she wa giving u our check ( some manager delivered the food to the table ) . no refill on my beverage , no how is your food , no ketchup for my burger or fry wa offered . lot of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people ! i will not be back again to eat .
i recently stopped there with my girlfriend and her kid to celebrate her daughter 21 is birthday . i ordered the fish and chip . do not order the fish and chip unless you want to lube your inside for month . i know i probably got the one that got away and they refried it 3 time . the outside breading wa hard a a rock and had no taste . the fish itself wa bland . after a few bite i called over the waiter who wa very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish wa by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise . he grabbed my plate and took it to his manager . but before doing so asked if i wanted something else i said no i had lost my appetite . the manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area . i wa thinking he would have stopped but did not oh well . the waiter took my meal it off the bill . i have eaten there before and the food wa good . sometime you just get one that is not .
i will have a biased opinion of any place like this . what could be wrong with playing old and new school game , drinking , and eating all at the same place ? the one thing i can think of is the price . on the surface , this is a pretty expensive place ; however , they give a bunch of good deal depending on the time you go , whether or not you `` donate '' money to the make-a-wish foundation , and if you are lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prize ! but honestly , know what the deal are before you go to make sure to get the best price available . in regard to the game , there is a plethora for your enjoyment . although it is nice to play game that spit out ticket , the last couple of time i have gone i have gotten 2 hour of arcade game for a very cheap price ( mario kart , anyone ? ! ) . either way , it is a really fun place that you will most certainly have a good time at .
first off , let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and buster usually do not care or seem to be angry and hate their job . a friend and i went here and found that a couple of the machine ran out ticket and someone wa always there and happy to help . the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time . the manager tony wa very sweet and made sure everything wa ok. every staff member we talked to wa extremely nice . this is by far the best dave and buster i have had been to !
my sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kid could play game after we all had some lunch together . this place is huge and wa moderately clean except the bathroom . all of the food looked great on the 16 page menu . when our food came though , everything wa below average . they have a huge selection of game for the kid to play , but you pay dearly to play game here . the food is overpriced and the drink are drastically overpriced .
we checked in at 7:00 pm on a saturday with a group of 19 for a birthday gathering . we were originally told 9:00 pm is when we 'd be seated , but that is not the problem , because we were able to play before being seated . we actually did not get seated until 10:00 pm , only to be told the kitchen wa taking 3 hour for people is order . did not see a manager until after 10:30 pm . needle to say , we did not stay to eat and went elsewhere .
ok , we went on a sat night with a large party , 2 hour wait for a table . fine that is understand then it turned to a three hour wait . once seated we were told the kitchen wa three hour behind and the wait for food would be three hour . the manger blamed u saying `` you came with a large party on a sat night , if you only order apps and not separate meal , you might get food in 45 min '' really ? it is the customer fault your staff can not handle a sat night rush . the table of 5 next to u waited 3 hour for food , when they got it it wa the wrong food ... i will never spend money here again ! ! ! to top it off the bathroom had no toilet paper and there wa pee everywhere !
this is a really fun way to spend an afternoon . after several visit here , i have found a couple game that are easy to win and score you lot of ticket , and others that are just a blast to play . we did really awesome last time we were here , and their prize room is full of some pretty neat stuff . their food is not too bad . i have only ever eaten here once , and it wa not that memorable , but i did not hate it . i did like that they have a bar , and they had my favorite beer on tap , that wa nice . like pretty much any arcade i have ever been to , there are thing that are a rip off , and occasionally something will not work properly . that really irritates some people but i figure no arcade is perfect . at least none that i have ever been to . the most irritating thing for me is that some of the game have a call button on them that signal an employee to come assist you , and i kept hitting the button with my leg or something , so every once in awhile someone would randomly appear at my side and ask if i needed help , and i would be really confused . haha . we went here with my husband is family on thanksgiving , and we had a total blast . the whole place wa pretty empty , and i felt really bad for the employee that had to work that day , but it wa nice for u !
awful awful . spent 150.00service wa terrible . took 27 minute to even be acknowledged . really . the only saving grace wa the kid had fun and the hostess took amazing care of u ... ...

4 star for the fun factory , game , and all around experience , but 2 star for the disgusting food and horrible service ! i wa so excited to come here for my boyfriend birthday . it always fun to play game , win ticket , and have fun with friends/family . we decided to eat here before we played . i keep seeing commercial for their new menu , so hey it could not be bad right ? wrong ! only thing that wa really good wa the corona-rita - but that is hard to mess up . first off , service wa horrible . i did not feel like any of the area were that packed to make the service so slow , but apparently i wa wrong . it took about 15 minute , minimum , to get our first drink . at least an hour for our food . i have boneless buffalo wing , which are hard to screw up , so mine were not bad but they were not the best . my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could not finish it . wa so salty and just not good . for the price of everything , it wa not worth it all . better off going somewhere else in the waterfront for food and then coming here to play . you will save $ $ , time , and frustration ! i guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your ticket . everything wa pretty picked over , which kinda sucked . overall it wa still fun , and i am sure i will be back to play some more game !
the service at the pittsburgh location wa so incredible awful that i actually took the time out of my day to write online how disappointed i wa , which i have never done before . it wa a saturday night and a someone who work in a restaurant im very sympathetic when it come to service . we sat at the high table in the bar area and we did not get greeted or even acknowledged for 30 minute . i personally had to get a manager and explain to him the situation and he treated me like i wa stupid ( maybe because im 17 ? ) also not to mention the little girl next to me is balling her eye out because she told her server of an egg allergy she ha and they still managed to mess it up and give her food marinated in egg . last i overhead they are heading to the hospital . i am not writing this message to be spiteful , i am writing it in hope that the future of your restaurant will improve . there is a big difference between service and hospitality and right now this place is lacking both . my best wishing for improvement
can we get a maintenance man ? and a janitor ? and a manager ? no ? ok ... i had a good time at dave and buster is , but that wa based mainly on the company i kept and not the venue . we went right when they opened for the day , with the intention of playing some pool . we located the pool table in an area that looked closed off , so we went to the hostess stand to ask . she radioed for help , got none , and finally went in search of an answer our question . when she came back , she said she could not find anyone , but a manager would be out to talk to u . we wait ... and wait ... and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area . all but one of the card purchase machine were rebooting , and the one we could use did not work . it take forever and finally give up and directs u to a non-existent ticketing attendant . so we again go off in search of someone to help . we flagged down a server , who issued u a card ( $ 56 for 375 token ) and served u a few cocktail ( average price , though my rum and coke wa teeny ) . and we are off to play some game . about every third game we tried wa broken in some way . either the token swipe did not work or the game itself wa messed up . it also wa not the cleanest place i have ever seen . they have table around the place to set your drink on , but most of them did not look a though they 'd been wiped from the day before ( which of course make we wonder when they last cleaned all the game that germy little kid touch all day ) .overall , they appeared completely unprepared for opening ( computer booting , employee not ready to work , soda gun at the bar not assembled , etc . ) and not well maintained or managed at all . the broken game were sort of comical after a while , but definitely not in a good way . if you are really looking to do this type of activity , i 'd try a different location for sure .
over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless . i think if you have a big screen tv at home and a wii you could order pizza get beer and have friend over and have the same experience without the price and glitz . i have yet to eat something here that impressed me . the arcade is a bit dated but i like playing the big trivia game more than anything ( again , you could just invite people over to play trivial pursuit ) . the new tv set up is pretty cool , but dave and buster is just what it is , an adult chuckie cheese not worth more than a visit a year , if that .
i have probably only been to 3 dave & buster is in my life , but this is probably my favorite one . it is a lot bigger and ha more variety of game than the other 2 i have been to , though they pretty much have the same game . the prize are also better here , and the ticket exchange rate for the prize seemed a lot more fair too . definitely take advantage of the half priced game on wednesday ! ! ! i do not come for the food , since it is very average . with all these good restaurant close by , why do not just eat somewhere else and come for the game ?
fell asleep last night before i got a chance to do my review this place is pretty cool it is just an arcade with a bunch of game they have a bar & u can order food a well the prize have gotten better however there a few game that were not working
i always go there to either eat dinner or have drink .never had a problem with the food or drink.sometimes i will play game there sometimes.the girl behind the counter are very nice even the one guy brett is also nice.he work very hard from what i can see a well a the girl that work there . even the one girl behind the counter wa dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink . although the restroom should be cleaned a little more .
wednesday is are half off game night . menu includes some meal that also provide ten dollar game card . it is loud and crazy but that is what is to be expected . the kid love this place . it is ok. not my thing but i understand the fascination .
im a fani went to this one october 2014 . i wa in town for my favorite nfl team the colt steelers game . i went to the game and had fun in the city.i went on half off wednesday . i really had fun with the game . im a young man and i like old nintendo game . i like all kind of game . the skee ball game acted up.i had funi will go back . not to this one because of the mile to far i will go to the ohio one.im a fan
great game and prize . amazing food.great way to enjoy your day with your family ! ! ! super busy place .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and 2 kid . server wa prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared . our food took 25 minute yet there wa only 4 table with people who were dining . grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should not take that long . game were fine . men room did not have any paper towel to dry hand with . huge fail for this type of venue .
i have been to dave and buster multiple time and i feel it a 2 star place.i can say the food quality is sub par . in my opinion the food price are expensive for what it is and quality . they do offer a nice bar , but then again the price in my opinion are a little higher . service is not too bad , but could be better.d & b is a great place for adult for sure , but the price for toke or `` game play '' is a little ridiculous . some game charge 6.9 credit to place . thats almost saying $ 1.50 a game and some of those game are addicting where i know most of u keep playing . i also thing d & b is not the cleanest place either . the bathroom near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion . doe not seem like they keep up with it . to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurant . all in all , d & b is an ok place to visit , but not a place i would frequently waste my money .
we had our reunion banquet last weekend at this d & b . it wa the highlight of our gathering . the room wa spacious , well-appointed with table covered with black tablecloth and set up according to our specification . the buffet wa delicious . the manager , server and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive . what a wonderful facility.kids and adult loved the arcade game . the pool table were a hit too . we appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.in the month leading up to our event , special event representative laura checked in regularly . she , sean and the manager made sure that our experience wa memorable and even added extra touch that made u feel special . thank you , d & b , for a great experience .
this wa not the cleanest place . dirty paper towel all over the woman is bathroom . no changing cover on the changing table to change your baby . very disappointed when i came here compared to the other two i have been too . also they are not following corporate policy . which ok , but when i asked about it to one of the manager on the way out , he said he did not honor the first responder discount like the other store do . which ok is fine , but he had a very sore attitude towards them . very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
i gave d & b 4 star because our waiter wa very geniune and nice ! the place ha definitely changed over the year , becoming a very pricey venue . the food wa mediocre . the fry were cold and the slider were subpar , almost like white castle from the freezer section in most grocery store . my buffalo wing were rather tough . a for the game , they were mostly the same , but included a lot of the newer 'app ' style game like flappy bird . skeeball and free throw were still fun , along with the coin drop machine . but , wow , we went through $ 50 of game really fast . the gift section is full of fun tchotchke and prize if you pay enough to rack up the point ! nevertheless , it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family , friend or coworkers .
had an awesome time here with my hubby the food wa amazing but the game cost so much an the prize where ok but all in all a good time i will be bring the kid with next time
the food here is awful . i came with a small group of people for dinner one night before heading out bar hopping at a few place at the waterfront . we gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of u , which can be challenging . i think the long wait time to get the drink and then the food wa due to the bartender and kitchen , but the waitress really tried her best.i only gave it 2 star because i liked my mac and cheese . everyone else at the table hated their food . they all had sandwich or other dish . the one girl resorted to eating only the topping off her sandwich because the bread wa too hard to bite through . the kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamp for 40 minute while preparing the rest of our table is food.i wa tempted to stop and play game for a couple minute , but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guy walked out of the restroom a well that had not washed their hand and immediately went over to start playing game . all i have to say is no thanks .
the food wa good but we waited an hour for our drink then 1.5 hour food then an hour for our bill . will not be back ! not busy at all so not sure what the problem wa . i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
worst service i have ever had ! we waited for over an hour for our food . after the waitress walked by 6 time without saying a word or refilling our drink we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give u a round but never said a word about our food . and told u her help never showed up . we waited another 30 min for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drink we got . we left and nothing wa even said about why we never got our food . no apology nothing . while sitting there we noticed 2 other party walked out a well . they did not even get their drinks.i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat . drink play game fine . i will never order food there again .
went to dave and buster to eat ... . no food . went to dave and buster to play.. no game . then i thought i 'd wet my whistle with a cool glass of h2o..they even ran out of water ... some lady even yelled at me in line to purchase game ticket accusing me of cutting line . such hostility . dave and buster ? more like beavis & butthead . smh
this is a place i 'd go to just for the game . the food wa bad . i had the chicken slider and there wa two piece of wood in the sandwich which i found in my mouth . granted the manager did take off the price of the slider but everyone is fry were lukewarm . my sister got the chicken finger and wow , there wa zero flavor or seasoning on it . the bathroom smelled like stale urine and the floor were very sticky . the waitress wa nice but overall i would not dine here again .
i wa sad to see of the bad review below because i love d & b . however , i wa just there this weekend and ha dinner then went to the midway . the food wa not bad but our service wa overwhelmed so we did not really have a server , and there were a couple small error with our order . the bathroom wa a wreck , like always . the trash can is always full , floor filthy , and smell strongly of urine . half of the game i played would not read my card on the first try.bartenders were slow & did not seem to care , except for the manager . i will be back for sure but this place need some serious staff updating .
if you are under 21 you must be accompanied by a 25 year old . not only is this a stupid rule , but the staff rudely expressed this and smirked at u because we were under 21 . awful place with rude people .
i made the mistake of selecting this place to meet up with my family who were visiting from florida . waited at bar for 20 minute before be able to order a drink even though there were only 3 other people at the bar . once the bartender did decide to wait on me , he wa very short `` what will you have ? '' and proceeded to give me a a receipt for the amount due before i could order 6 more drink for the rest of our party ? ? ? we eventually left that bar after no one returned to our group sitting at the bar for the following 25 minute . we then moved onto the restaurant where we waited for 45 minute for our entree to arrive . food wa pretty good.moved onto gaming area where approximately 1 out of 5 game were not operating properly . this place ha really gone down hill in the past 3-4 year . we will not be going back !
if you are here to just play game , then it a great deal of fun , and is also a fantastic place to catch a sporting event . if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else . i have tried eating here on several occasion and find that it is for the most part terrible . nothing taste like it is fresh at all . i would guess everything is delivered frozen and then either deep fried or heated in a microwave . i can not think of any meal i have ever finished here either from being bland or just plain lousy . even my 11 year old , who love wing and chicken finger ( 2 staple here ) think the food is terrible and refuse to eat here , even though he love to play the game . my advice , eat somewhere else then head here to play .
4pm on a friday afternoon and i got turned away for being 8 day under 21 i had no intention drinking and there wa all of 4 people in the place even if i wa 21 i would go to river downtown it is not like they can put a wristband saying i am 20 or anything .
worst service wver i asked for someone to come over 3 time and we sat at a table for 20 minute while a whole swarm of server were just walking around passing u . not to mention alllll the table in the whole game room were dirty . even manager saw u sitting there and didnt bother to greet u . drink took forever too and it wasnt busy at all the bartender did not care much they stood there for awhile . we will still go here just not try to eat . they need some structure in the work atmosphere .
my sister and i have always gone here together by ourselves . i am 18 and my sister are younger than i am . a we walked in , they would not let u go in unless we were all 21 , if we were not 21 we had to be with someone 25 . i called the manager & he told me that it ha always been a rule , even though the website say 18 . which i wa , and i wa not allowed in . the manager ended up hanging up on me . they have turned something for teenager into a place for adult . i am extremely disappointed in how the staff and manager delt with this and will not return to this specific dave n buster .
had fun playing game and drinking here ! lot of game and prize . great atmosphere including a dj ! on a side note , some creepy middle aged man came up to me and my wife asking if he get u a certain amount of ticket on a game ( which we had to pay for ) then we buy him an alcoholic beverage . what in the world is wrong with this man ? ! ? ! could not find any management worker to advise so we just walked away and avoided him for the rest of the night .
game are okay . however , this place is highly unhygienic . they do not clean any silverware , plate etc . avoid eating or drinking anything here .
the service wa terrible . game are game at any dave & buster but service make or break this place . i understand it wa busy tonight because of the fight , but that is no excuse for rude employee ... especially multiple employee , hostess , waitress , and bus boy . the manager on the other hand wa great and gave u a very reasonable explanation for a server being very rude . either way , on a saturday night , i would not recommend going here .
we do not generally come here , a it is somewhat of a hike from our home , but we decided to wander out this way today . last time we were here , we were not pleased , but today , we had a much better experience . they had a ton of new game , which is a bonus ! all of them were working too ... ..double bonus ! i think they are a bit expensive , but it wa a treat to go , so we did not mind spending a couple of extra bucks.after playing out the credit on our card , we decided to have a late lunch . the menu is quite large , but ha a great selection . our server , kiara , wa wonderful ! you could tell she wa stressed out from her day , but she wa very pleasant . we are pretty easy to take care of and you could almost hear the sigh of relief she gave when we told her to take her time and were ready to order when she wa able to make it back from another table.the restroom were gross and the hostess stand wa filled with confused girl who could not have cared le . the prize room wa so empty of prize , we decided to keep our point for our next visit.we will be back , we will ask for kiara to be our server , and hopefully we will be able to find prize worth taking home !
nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude . refused to give me back change from kiosk malfunction . made me leave because i wa with my girlfriend who wa 20 and i wa 23. supposed rule about someone under 21 need to be with someone 25. rule is in about 3 size font . highly recommend that no one ever go here .
worst service ever and all of our food wa either cold or not what we ordered . waited over a hour for our food a well . our service wa awful a well . bathroom were so disgusting and un-kept . i do not think i have one good thing to say about this place .
dave and buster is a nice franchise to be able to enjoy arcade game for a more mature crowd . defiantly enjoy coming here every time my friend and i do . con : food - food is not very tasty , feel `` generic '' and not worth the $ listed for it . bathroom - no , i do not go out of my way to down star a place for their bathroom but this is ridiculous . toilet paper everywhere , sinks/floor covered in water , and no paper towel ? pro : atmosphere - nice place to come grab a drink , watch a sporting event , or meet new people . game - who doe not like game ? they have a ton of variety from hoop to racing . afterwards ( if you are lucky ) you can redeem token at their reward store .
i have loved coming here since it first opened a part of the waterfront shopping development , and i am always up for a game of skee-ball ! the pittsburgh d & b location is recently remodeled , so if you have not been there in a while , do yourself a favor and check it out . they have expanded the dining area and added new , modern furniture , there are more tv than you can shake a stick at , a menu with something for everyone , and of course ... game ! they also recently opened a new show in their theater room -- pittsburgh magician lee terbosic will be performing 2 show every friday and saturday night . you can even order drink and food off the menu while you take in the show ! i went to the opening show this past friday night , and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a `` sno-cone '' ( hint : this drink is not one for the kiddos ! ) to wash it down with . both were great -- the sno-cone flavor were just like an icee i would get on a childhood shopping trip with mom and dad , but with that added kick of booze . hey , i am not one to complain . speaking of added kick , the quesadilla ha jalapeno in it , which i loved ! ! i love spicy food and most place just serve a little cup of jalapeno on the side . these were actually cooked into the filling and i loved every bite.the show itself wa highly entertaining and the crowd seemed to agree -- lee kept everyone on their toe for the entire 60 minute . i can not wait to check out more show here and flex my skee-ball arm !
i know the reason for coming here is not the food , but this wa ridiculous . the five of u sat at one of the table around the bar in the game room.we still did not have napkin or cutlery when our appetizer ( nacho ) came , and asked for some , please . she brought a pile of beverage napkin . when we pointed out the problem she went away and eventually came back with ... .more beverage napkin . it wa a little messy , but we managed with our fingers.still did not have any cutlery or proper napkin when the food came . the woman that brought the food did not think it wa her job to get them for u , and we were not going to eat salad and pasta with our finger , so eventually we walked around to hunt up our waitress , who , fifteen minute after the food , finally delivered the tool with which to eat it.that wa also our first opportunity to point out to her that one of u had ordered a salad , and had been delivered a pasta dish , completely unrelated , instead . fifteen more minute and she finally delivered the salad that had actually been ordered . but that is not the worst . one of the pasta dish that *had* been ordered arrived without any sauce , just the naked pasta . we do not know why . despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that . maybe she thought it wa easier to eat with your finger that way.anyway , do not try to eat here . just come and play the game , but skip the food .
i went to this establishment hoping for a fun time where i can leave my two child in the car and forget about my responsibility for a few hour . at first i enjoyed the freindly environment and enjoyed the attractive waitress , however thing went south fast there were child everywhere and i am not a nice person aroud child when i drink ... lol . these kid hogged up everygame the entire night leaving me creating my own entertainment which involved staring at there young mom and older sister . i wish there were no kid . after a few hour and a 3 course meal i decided to make my own fun . i kicked a child off a racing game chair and they precided to cry like a little girl . she wa definitely old enough to understand why she wa wrong . after a few choice word with management i will never go back there again and will only lock my kid inside of my car somewhere more adult like seabase .
how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kid . i drove 40 minute to take my younger brother to dave and buster for a fun afternoon but we were denied . their policy state anybody under the age of 21 must be accompanied by an adult over the age of 25 . i am 22 year old and i do not understand why i can not bring my 12 year old brother to play game . we have gone many time a year for the past 15 year . after today experience , i will not be going back , whether i am with kid or not .
if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating . 2.5 hour wait and then cold food served . did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide update . bathroom atrocious . nothing positive to say other than do not go there .
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night . staff is rude . half the game do not work . the food is the only good thing this place ha because it is somewhat unique . i did a survey that wa on my receipt and gave my negative experience and it said a a manger would be in touch based on my answer and it is been a week and no call . what a joke .
so i have been coming here for quite a well , and i have always been a fan . upon entering the restaurant at 6pm on a friday , our id were checked . you have to have at least one person who is 21+ to be seated -- -this is odd but okay . while we are looking at the menu , a man show up out of nowhere with a camera asking to take our picture for a keychain -- it is free but he is `` working for tip '' . other than these two odd happening , the meal wa great . i ordered the fire-grilled salmon and it is one of the best salmon dinner i have ever had . i will definitely return again for game and drink .
apparently it is socially unacceptable to continue going to chuck e. cheese after you have reached puberty . this i learned the hard way . fortunately , the genius behind dave & buster got my back . sometimes i just need to escape the stress of adulthood with a few round of skee-ball ( do not judge me ) . i can work with the amount and variety of game , but it could definitely be better . i would suggest coming in on wednesday for half-price game to get more bang for your buck ! be aware of the obnoxious guest . i expect child to be a bit rowdy , but even some adult suddenly forget all socially acceptable behavior once you throw them in the arcade . i come to d & b for the game and not the food . aside from the horrible customer service i have experienced , their food also taste generic and mediocre . for the price they are charging , it is not worth it . save a few buck and find a better meal elsewhere .
came here for my son is birthday . waited 20 minute for our drink and an additional 49 minute for our food . the waitstaff really did not appreciate having to take break from their cellphone to seat/serve u . had to ask over and over for drink , water , silverware ... .etc . i could understand if they were busy , but it wa not at all . i ordered the sirloin , which wa poorly kept/cooked . the food wa not very good at all . game were fun ... a always . eat before you come to play !
you are either going to have the best service of your life or you are going to sit at the bar for an hour waiting for your quesadilla to come out . there is no in between yet 4,000 ticket later i still come back . i see no fun in the casino so dave and buster is my adult casino that still make me nostalgic about my childhood . i enjoy the hoop game , the top 40 music , the yummy eats and most of their cocktail menu is pretty darn impressive . i always go for the passion fruit sangria or the backwoods lemonade that come with a shot in a mini solo cup . they can be pricey after a while that is why i show up for happy hour . if you are into gaming do show up on a wednesday where all game are half off .
went here with friend on a saturday afternoon ... the dining area wa not busy at all ... though you 'd have thought by the service it wa packed full ... .it took forever for our drink to come out ( which are way overpriced ) ... the food is very sub par for the price , would have been better off eating before we went to play..my entree came out , plate hot , food completely cold . i have never sent back food , ever , but this wa ridiculous . the server take my plate , and say they would make it right . i did not receive a fresh entree , it wa put in the microwave and sent back to me . how do i know ? the bread and meat in the sandwich wa still torn apart , which i did while checking my food the first time to see if it wa warm inside . they did however take it off my check , but never giving me a menu or asking me if i 'd like to order something else , so my friend at the table gave me leftover rib and fry off their plate . by the time the server came back so i could ask for something else , the table wa already done eating , so i just sucked it up and when went on our way to play the arcade . i highly recommend eating somewhere good , and then just go to d & b to play . *waitress sucked *overpriced food and drinks*very average food quality , though lot of menu choices*arcade wa fun ! *nice location , easy to get to
despite asking specifically for an appointment at the peter is township office , they scheduled the visit for bethel park which only ha physician is assistant , not doctor . wa then told that they do not have any opening so it wa bethel park or nothing . can not say much for an office that is managed this way . the lack of empathy wa even more disturbing .
the doctor were knowledgeable but the staff at the call center wa rude and not accommodating . it wa also not convenient to get an appointment . i waited an hour and a half to be seen when i wa the only patient in the office . the drug rep came with food so i guess patient do not matter .
someone named teresa erroneously gave this practice my cell phone number . the staff from this practice repeatedly called my cell phone over the course is a week to ask for this person , even after i told them each time that they had the wrong number and tried to clear it up . worse yet , when i politely told the staff member each time about the problem , they rudely slammed the phone down and hung up . the staff at this practice need a lesson in professionalism and courtesy , and need to mark their file to indicate that they have a wrong number listed . do not take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
fresh and good ... but i wa starving . i will obviously be returning since i have such a favorable memory . i must say , though , my spicy chicken sandwich wa fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot and very crispy while my bun wa toasted . the french fry were also fried to an artery clogging perfection .
this is the wendys that made me never want to eat at wendy is ever again . to think i gave it a second a third and even a fourth try ! i guess convenience get dollar but after so long , you will stop getting mine.the employee here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duty and the attitude carry itself right over to the register . the management is not any better telling me to go somewhere else if i do not like it then . this place is the reason people scoff at giving $ 15 a hr to fast food employee . the frosty is never frosty always runny . the burger are slapped together and the dining room look more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.the only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back .
tried going twice . twice i got a `` were closed '' i said i thought you were open till 1 ? `` nah '' it wa 12 . i thought wendy is advertises that they are open until 1 ? like thats their commercial campaign . guess not . cant rate the food cause i have not received any . i would have loved to try . but since it 1210 guess they are closed . do not worry wendy is . maybe you should add 100+ soda to this location but do not worry i wont have any from this one or any . i am done w this franchise .
it took an hour to get our food when everyone else got their food in five minute . they forgot two of our drink and one of the employee said a cuss word infront of a child .
best wendy is in pittsburgh ! it doe have competition with white oak but thats besides the point . i went in here earlier today and they are fast , they are neat and clean and the staff is friendly . the manager even help the elderly and speaks with customer like they are friend . job well done in my book . plus can not beat the fry are always hot . keep the work up guy !
wa in there today again and the service is excellent . is this a chica filum or wendy is i can not tell the difference except for the menu . cashier will bring your food to you . manager actually ha respect for the customer instead of ignoring them . i love it !
this wendy is is awesome ! i got the 4 for 4 . the cashier wa so nice . she let me trade my drink for a frosty , no charge , and she stacked overfull but not messy . my food wa ready when i wa and it wa quality food for great value ! their chicken nugget are the freshest i have found .
so i am doing laundry on a lazy , rainy afternoon and just before i am about to snuggle in for a nap , i go down to the basement to put my laundry into the dryer and found the basement floor covered in raw sewage . so , it friday night , 5pm ... .yeah right ... who is gon na even bother answering ? these guy did . ed wa here in about an hour . he wa very professional ( he even put booty on his foot before coming into the house ) , explained exactly what he wa doing and described what the problem wa and how to prevent it from happening in the future . and guess what ! he clean too ! now , back to my laundry ... .what a way to spend a friday night .
i can not say enough good thing about these guy . i swear , when it rain it pours ... literally . i went down to the basement and discovered water all over the floor and a spray coming out of a water line and shooting to the ceiling . i have had way too many `` oh shit '' moment like these this summer . this time , the saddle valve connection for my ice maker burst . thank you again to rdn plumbing for rescuing me and installing the proper type of valve . a always , you guy were prompt and professional . : )
getting a new refrigerator installed can be daunting . the delivery man could not hook it up unless the water line wa on same floor . rdn wa here while the delivery man wa still here . so far , so good , right ? even though rdn had to go back to the shop to get the correct part he came right back . job well done . the next morning the water dispenser wa only giving u a small trickle so i called for help again . rdn wa here in fifteen minute . the installer had not blown air out of the filter first . rdn did it.kudos for great , caring service .
got a good quote for some kitchen sink drain and laundry plumbing update and had them come back and do the work the next month . fast , reliable , and great work done . very happy with both the quoting process and definitely the work that they have done .
we used rdn plumbing who wa recommended by aha ( american home shield ) to help fix a clogged drain . a guy named justin came and helped u . after he left the drain wa unclogged but the pipe below the sink wa leaking . we left the country for vacation and have been swamped in construction afterwards . we called aha for a recall to have rdn come back and fix the leaking pipe . i woke up at 830 am to justin screaming ( and i mean screaming so loud that i wa alarmed in bed with earplug in ) . he wa questioning my husband about why we waited 3-4 week to call it in . after my husbad explained that we were out of the country he implied thatmy husband messed with the pipe himself . my husband stayed calm and told him that he just need to fix the problem from not putting pipe back together correctly . then my husband askd if he could call aha and see if the leaking faucet would be covered . he went out to his truck and called and then came barging back in with a wrench and started fixing the faucet by literally turning the wrench twice . he told my husband while turning the wrench that it wasnt covered . my husband tried to get im to stop because he only wanted to know if it wa covered . justin freaked out again and wrote up a whole new work order . he gave u the bill and stormed off . the even wrote on the statement `` i am not going to be told how to do my job '' . i have never seen a temper tantrum from a so called professional in my life . i al would like to add that i have never left a 1/5 star for any service professional and we are no stranger to house remodeing .
hot water tank burst in the middle of a shower , had to go to work shortly after . got to work frustrated knowing this is really going to cost me . remembered i had a home warranty and i called them up to see what kind of situation i am really in , they said no issue and contracted rdn to me . nick ? i believe it wa arrived promptly this morning from rdn , wa extremely professional and wa more than generous with information regarding the draining of the tank on a bi-yearly basis ( something of which i did not know to do ) . he wa polite and cleaned up after himself . they alleviated my issue and made me very happy . they are a little out of my range for basic need a i live roughly 40 minute from homestead but i would highly recommend them to anyone . awesome folk .
this morning our water heater broke all over our new carpeting in our basement . i called our home warranty company and they said rnd plumbing would be here between 9-11 . ed from rnd arrived promptly , introduced himself , asked u a few question and got right to work . he had to leave to purchase the new tank and came back in a timely manner . he wa very careful not to dirty our carpeting when taking out the old tank . ed wa very professional , friendly and he helped to put my mind at ease during a stressful morning . he explained how to maintain the new tank to make it last longer . i highly recommend rnd plumbing and their technician ed ! he certainly exceeded our expectation ! !
these guy are on time and professional , and that is what matter most . i have used them twice , and i will never call anybody else for my plumbing need again .
ordered pizza and wing from here with delivery . the pizza wa pretty decent but the wing were just so-so . the price were pretty good and delivery wa quick . i will definitely order pizza from here again .
if there wa a way to give no star i would . horrible service . wa given a time frame or 45-50min for delivery , after waiting an hour we called and wa told food wa on the way they sent the delivery guy out with 6 order . after another 30min we called back and wa told pizza wa still there because they ran out of part of our order . they said they 'd bring it right away . waited another 20min we live about 1.5 mile away from the place still nothing . so we called back and asked for our money back . they never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter . and oh since we used a card it is going to be 3-4 day to see the refund . at least pay cash so when they do not show you know you will not be ripped off at least .
if you want terrible pizza go here . save money go buy a frozen pizza and it will be better than this place
ordered a hot sausage parmesan hoagie , fried zucchini and a cheese steak hoagie , none of which were edible . i can not believe still how bad they were , this establishment should stick to pizza only ! not worth one star ! ! yuch !
this joint is recently under new management , so we decided to give it another try tonight , and i am pleased that we did . we ordered pickup and the food wa done by the time i arrived at the estimated pickup time - no waiting around ! ! brought home a calzone , pizza , and garlic knot . everything wa super tasty , good quality ingredient , piping hot . great value for what we paid . definitely our new favorite pizza joint in munhall ! !
horrible beer , horrible service , horrible menu
summary : if i wa in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go , i might come back for beer and appetizers.good : - decent beer ... - original pretzel appetizer . you take chunk of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.- huge portion . most of u had leftover . the rb appetizer sampler wa multi-story and way more food that we could handle . the half order of rib looked like a full rack.- attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.- amusing name.bad : - lot of food choice ... burger ... steak ... chicken ... salad . lot of drink choice ... beer ... wine ... mixed drink . i guess this could be seen a good , but it take a while for everyone to pick something and since no one is awesome at everything , you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.- none of the food wa super awesome . nothing wa awful , but nothing stood out in any way . i have had better beer , appetizer , and a better main course at plenty of breweries.- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.come if you want bar food , but keep your expectation low .
i am a big fan of rock bottom.there are several dish that are money.appetizer : seared ahi , spinach artichoke dipentree : fire steak , pub tip or chicken fried chicken.desert : carrot cake ( to die for ) bar food : pizza or ball park pretzel . both of which are sprayed with brown ale . half the menu is really good , the other half is great . the beer is good . ask for the sampler ! they usually have a velvet and something on cask . ask for one of those if you are looking for something different . they will also have a scotch ale , an ipa , whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer ( which , if it still matt , the mood is grumpy ) . if andy is still working there , he is sure to please and molly is great in the cocktail area.head over to sing sing after dinner and it a wrap.i used to work there several year ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly can.do not go to the one in charlotte though , it not really a rock bottom .
i thought this place wa pretty decent . my friend and i were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salad ... and they were huge . and tasty . i liked my salad though it wa slathered in way too much dressing . my friend is wa even more slathered so she did not dig it too much . we 'd also ordered chip with guacamole , the guac wa pretty good . my friend enjoyed her beer . i enjoyed my coke ( i know , i am lame ) .so yeah ... wa not bad , wasnt the best , but it wa okay .
microbrewed beer are only a plus to me when they are better than the beer i would have drank otherwise . one waitress i had while there tried to split the upright between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beer a `` kind of like coors light '' . if i wanted coors , i will pay half a much and have one . the food is actually a saving grace , a it wa pretty good . head next door to sing sing for drink , though .
not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.i like the food and i have tried all the beer . they are just `` ok '' a far a beer goes.large portion . friendly staff .
my friend got everyhing from steak ( they did not even get a well done steak right ) to mahi taco and the only great menu item wa the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss . sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else . after we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the check and i had ordered meal that came with a desert ! really dissapointing all around .
everytime i come here i stick with the nacho add chicken add side of guac and i have never been dissappointed . i sit in the bar , grab a drink or 2 and eat those nacho . the bar ha a pool table and plenty of flatscreens . rock bottom is a chain but it is one of the better chain in the area . i will pas on chili is or friday is and come to rock bottom instead . oh and typically i walk over to target - work off some of those nacho .
nobody ha reviewed this in a while , but i am surprised at the lack of lovin ' ! my husband and i ate here a few night ago and we liked it a lot.we started with drink -- he got the house-brewed portland wheat and said it wa quite a good beer , and i got a mixed drink ( red rock ) that wa also tasty . he got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and i got a mahi sandwich . both great -- the fry and side salad are good here too , and there is no skimping on portion of anything . there were ton of thing on the menu that i am looking forward to trying.we are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake -- who can resist a beer cheesecake , come on ! our food and service wa great . they had the penguin game on all the tv in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game . seriously , what is not to like ! ? i am thinking this place ha changed for the better since the last review a year ago ... : )
this is literally the first place i went when i first came to pittsburgh - and i loved it . hearty , full-sized meal , lot to choose from , and not too crowded or noisy . although , for the sake of full disclosure , i did not sit at the bar and i do not drink alcohol so i can not comment on that . i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom end up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night . really , i have no complaint about this place so i am surprised by the few low rating here .
little slow on the service and did not have the beer i wanted on the menu . but you get those thing when they brew their own beer on-site . but the stadium pretzel are good . the cream stout is tasty.the burger are good and big with the little skinny fry . i am not a fan of the skinny fry , but hey the burger would choke a horse - and almost did . : o )
lately , the rock bottom is hit or miss . the beer are always good and the uppity jagoff ipa is one of the best india pale ale i have ever tasted . the low point lately ha been the food . i will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu . that said , i ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived , the bread wa a hard a a brick and cold . the filling wa okay , but the lobster flavor wa masked by over spicing . i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom .
pretty good ! excellent beer sampler - bargain ! veggie burger awesome . onion ring awesome . fried mac n cheese wa delicious - crunchy on the outside , creamy on the inside . carrot cake wa monstrously huge and delicious .
first off , i will say that i just moved here from california and wa a big patron at the rockbottom in long beach . i came to the homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.now , rockbottom is a chain brewery , so a lot wa the same ... the menu , the food price ( yet beer is cheaper , and i am fine with that ) . i have always found their food to be pricey , but they use excellent ingredient and it ha always been tasty and filling so i am fine with that . the food here wa just a good a the long beach location , so i have no problem with the chef at all.service wa good , our waitress wa very friendly and helpful . i wish that they had asked u if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour wa still going , but that is not a big thing . went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender is attention , but he wa very friendly and i got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned i had just moved here ... i really enjoyed that.beer : we got the beer sampler to try the whole list ... and , well ... i found the dark beer a bit lacking in comparison . the light beer and the wheat were amazing , very impressed . the pale wa ok , a wa the velvet pale that wa one of the special of the night ... but both were way too citrusy . the uppity ipa wa very good ... i do not usually like ipas because the hop overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance . still , could not do a whole glass . i felt the imperial stout had a bitter burned taste that wa overpowering ... i almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it ( not ice cream malt , for the non-homebrewers ) . the brown and amber were decent , but bland . i ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and wa able to finish it all without forcing it ... . one point up on long beach , who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass wa empty.i really wanted to try the da gut dopplebock , but they were out . look like they will have it in bottle to go soon so i hope i can catch that . also want to try the snow moon belgian.verdict : while i wa not too impressed with the dark beer , i found the lighter one very good and i look forward to trying the other seasonal beer . it is a good hour drive south to get there , so i will not be going too often , but i will be back .
even since rock bottom opened ( 7 year ago ? ? ? ) i have always thought it wa a dance club . i am not really sure why but i thought it wa along the same line a ( throw back ) hi-tops but i did . i think i always thought this place wa a club because of the behemoth size of the space . well i wa out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the improv and rock bottom wa close . part of this is my fault ... i always order `` healthy '' item at place that specialize is greasy bar food ... then i am upset when the meal is not 5 star . i started off with one of their wheat beer , it wa alright . i nursed it all through dinner so i do not think i wa head over heel in love with it . i got the catch of the day , off the hook , fish dish , sailor delight or something ( i forget it had some cheesy fish themed name ) . it wa cod ( meh , that should have been the sign not to get it ) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice . the fish wa suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading ( annoyed ) and the portion of fish wa tiny . the rice and asparagus were great though . my friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fry were pathetic . the fry were probably pre-cut frozen fry or just very poorly executed . they were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.pros : a lot of table ( no wait ) , brew special beer , big menu , could hear the dueling piano bar next doorcons : place wa fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it wa 5 degree outside , most of the food wa fried , cheese filled , cream based , or wrapped in bacon . i know some people love to eat food like this all the time ( i do every once in awhile ) but if you eat out a lot you can not always get the spin dip , burger , and ice cream sundae . ( i would love to but it just not in my card ) . i do like like when causal place offer some healthy option .
went with a group after work for dinner and a brew . we ordered a few appetizer first . the wing are good and the soft pretzel with spicy spinach cheese dip wa fun . had a burger , you can create your own from veggie , turkey , or fresh ground beef . had a fresh ground beef and the meat wa fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.the brew pub is nice and wa surprised it wa not busier .
here is the trick to enjoying a meal at rock bottom : do not get fancy with your food order . stick with the sandwich , salad , burger , and bar food ; and you will be ok . i have had bad experience will all the fish dish ( including the fish and chip ) . also , i have found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area . join the mug club , even if you do not go often , and rack up point for free mug and beer . thursday are trivia night and the dj is playing the music loud , so go if you do not really want to have a conversation with the person you are with : )
beer selection wa good , but they were out of the one we wanted . 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steak all of them were cooked to their satisfaction . the bourbanzola wa a good addition . defiantly a place i would go again . joe , our server , wa awesome and super friendly .
i love this place ! great atmosphere and friendly service every time i go ! !
rock bottom is a nice hangout place . often when you are out and about with friend you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise . great if your out to see a band , but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you . depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booth and table . it is alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area . the bar area give you a choice of sitting at the surrounding table with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself . complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brew cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender . when the weather cooperates the outdoor patio house about 6 table for outdoor dining . the view however ... not so picturesque , just the entrance to the improv . which hey , that could be the perfect seat if you are stocking the local comic ! the bar area contains pool table and dart board to try your skill . on any give night sport fan can enjoy the game of the day on one of the 6 big screen tv surrounding the bar area . the menu is pretty decent with burger that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken . they have a number of specialty burger with different cheese , topping and creative theme . the bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a bourbon based glaze and gorgonzola cheese . appetizer which range from nacho to firecracker shrimp . steak , pasta and salad with rotating special from different area of the menu . on monday the burger are half off ... i do not think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special . however , if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gift and special . http : //www.rockbottom.com/mc needle to say i have a fun beer glass collection thanks to rock bottom ... lol ! now everyone favorite part about rock bottom is beer ! the in house brew master keep it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorite of ale , ipa is , rotating dark and kolsch . stop by on thursday night for a colorful game of trivia where team battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skill !
we have all had this happen to u - you go past a place one hundred time and never go on . then , once you finally do , you realize how many opportunity you wasted ! rock bottom is definitely a solid bar . a a microbrewery , their beer list is full of house brew . there are better beer in the world , but there are a lot of worse beer out there , too . what really make rock bottom standout , though , is the food . my girlfriend and i shared an order of nacho , and it took everything we had to finish them . they also make a mean soft pretzel . the waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh , but no trip to the waterfront , is complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom .
i would have to say i am pretty partial to rock bottom , i have been going almost every thursday for the past 3 year because of the fantastic `` team trivia '' . my friend and i love the atmosphere , the dj ( todd ) , and the service that we get at rock bottom . every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it , except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new ! a an avid rock bottomer , hand down i have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have had here at rock bottom . whether i have eaten dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant , my favorite and my food of choice is the enormous ball park pretzel with the cheese dip . it is a meal itself ! the mixture of onion , cheese , spinach and tomato is perfection ! another favorite of mine is the barbecue chicken pizza , it ha a great kick to it and it is big enough for two people . the service ha always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff . a truly great place to have fun with friend and meet new people ! come to team trivia every thursday at 8pm !
rock bottom on thursday night is the place to be . team trivia start at 8pm and it is free to play . the dj ( todd ) is great . the food is good , but the ball park pretzel with spicy spinach cheese dip is the best . the wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of thing , a few server are excellent . i am not a beer drinking so i have not tried the microbrews but the mixed drink i have had have been good and a few of thier special perfect . on night that are not trivia night , rock bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party . larger party will usually be split into two table . overall , an enjoyable place at which i am a regular .
so i have not been to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurant , but since i wa with colleague on travel for work and they chose this place i went along . first surprise : decent beer . i remembered the normal rb brewery beer were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new style , including a very good imperial ipa that for $ 5/glass can not be beat . second surprise : pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy option than i expected . recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great . service wa a little slow ( not sure why ) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5 . i will be back next time i am in pittsburgh for work .
the beer is good . their light beer , lumpy dog , is very good -- doe not taste like a light beer . when i wa pregnant i became quite a fan of their root beer float , too.as others have noted , the pretzel are really good . i am not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband like it . veggie burger are always good , too , though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order , say , the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger . long , long ago , when i used to go to the rock bottom in boston , there wa a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that wa fantastic ... if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star !
i always feel like i am constantly bashing brewery for their food , but in my opinion , i feel the bar is raised for place like this . it seems there are so many brewery out there that offer great beer , and slack off on the food . unfortunately rock bottom is one that fall into that category . let is be honest , when you go to a brewery , you want the full experience . if it wa only about the beer , i 'd go buy a growler and take it home . so , about the beer ... .excellent ! ! ! ! ! the jagoff ipa is with out a doubt one of the best ipas i have ever had ! they only i can think of that i think is better is dogfish head , but that is a matter of opinion . the beer selection is constantly changing , and they always have some excellent seasonal beer . you can not go wrong , there is bound to be a beer everyone will like . a for the food ... ... .it is pretty much a crap shoot . sometimes it is good , sometimes it is terrible . my biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it come to the food . one time it is perfect , then maybe it is cold , or it is burned , or it taste completely different from the last time you had it . unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality . that is pretty much it . this place fix it is food consistency , and it is a five star place . till then , it is hit or miss !
i wa so ready to like this place ! turn out , not so much . it wa okay . no better than tgifridays , but better than eat n park ! the deets.the hubster and i were here on a saturday evening after a show at the improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats . we ordered drink . he a wheat beer of their brewing , me my fave bloody mary with absolut peppar . the hubster deemed the beer acceptable , but would not go out of his way to come back just for another one ... .yes , he did order another one `` just to be sure . '' my bloody sucked . watered down tomato juice with no discernible peppar of any kind , let alone any other seasoning . even a good standard mix would have been better . our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it wa remade by the other bartender . nope , no better at all . that went back and i went with a you-can't-screw-it-up amaretto sour . it wa fine.hub ordered a reuben - why , i will never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented gazebo in shadyside . you younguns would not have a clue of the establishment of which i speak . he said this one wa `` fine . '' i had the texas fire steak with jalapeno butter which i enjoyed very much ! packed a punch of heat and flavor , but the side were uninspired . steamed veggie . any flavor wa steamed out in the process - eh . cheddar mashed potato - there wa cheddar in there ? ? ? ? ? no way ! the tab wa reasonable - we did have a living social deal that took $ 30 off , so our check wa for $ 12 and change , not including tip . not bad ( even with the $ 15 cost of the l deal ) , but had we paid full price , it would not have been worth the experience . we will hit the improv again - we have before - but , we will head somewhere else afterwards .
i must admit , i do like the brew . i also like the white cheddar mash potato . other than that , meh . the food is pretty forgettable . another `` brewery '' that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department . with the restaurant upping the ante on 8th ave , you may want to kick it up a notch rock bottom . but how would anyone know to ? it is a chain . whomp whomp !
for a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potato & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to germany . not worth $ 5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter wa $ 15.95 .
dined in twice , food ok , atmosphere good .
i have always been pleasantly surprised with the food i have gotten at rock bottom . i say `` surprised ' because with any restaurant that fall into the slippery territory of a `` chain '' , you expect to find your fair share of culinary dud . but i have really had a lot of good meal at rock bottom . now , granted , you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are ( a `` bar-straunt '' if you will ) , and do not get anything above and beyond this place is call of duty . for instance , i will never be ordering the ahi tuna . i will leave that to my favorite sushi bar and restaurant a bit closer to the water ( the mon doe not count ... .. ) .but besides that , i always really enjoy my meal choice . i have recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich . chicken wa grilled perfectly , plenty of avocado , and it wa a good sized sandwich without being excessive . i have also ordered the margherita pizza , which could definitely be split between two people . it is an eight cut that come to you on a big wooden pizza paddle . the pizza wa really great . the crust wa crispy , it had a good balance of cheese and tomato , and the basil pesto wa fresh and tasty . and not greasy whatsoever - big bonus point there . but my biggest surprise a of late wa when i ordered their chicken flautas . i am a huge mexican food fan and always hesitate to order mexican outside of a mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed . but i had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it . it wa delicious . the flautas are deep fried which give you an amazing crunch , and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredient . the accompanying rice wa nice and moist a well . i wa so happy ! i have always been quite happy with the service there a well . i go on thursday evening for trivia , and nine time out of ten the service is really spot on . the lady servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive . only once or twice , to my memory , ha my service been sub-par , and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed trivia night with only two visible server helping 50+ people.i definitely give rock bottom two thumb up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh , yummy , and worth coming back for more .
i went to rock bottom this past weekend , and it wa `` nice '' to see that nothing ha changed in the year or two since my last visit . while the beer is pretty good , it ha never outweighed the fact that the service is not good and the food is average , at best.it wa even difficult to get beer at the bar ... we tried to have the girl order , thinking they 'd have better luck ... when that failed , the men tried ... that did not work either . if we had not really wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv , we would have just left . it definitely wa not busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender , so i can not overlook it . of course , the service ha always been spotty at rock bottom , so it wa hardly surprising.combine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink , and you get the exact formula that is kept me from going there in the past ... and will keep me from going often in the future .
happy hour at rock bottom , 2 thumb up ! good price , the pizza is delicious , drink are a few dollar off the regular price , good service , and the atmosphere is always casual and fun .
the only reason rock bottom get 3 star is because of the brew . food wa `` eh '' , not many vegetarian option and hostess who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who did not text them back . this place ha the potential to be great , but sadly , it fall way too short in almost all area .
watch the fat girl in here . they will try to steal your buddy chair in a sec if he go to the bathroom & then the indignent fat girl had to get yelled at in front of everyone w/ in ear shot . everything else including the burger & beer i devoured wa excellent .
rock bottom wa our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl . a expected , the bar wa lively , the food wa good , and the service wa accommodating , the beer are better than church brew work and the bar wa populated . the bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave u a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl . i vote for rock bottom a the anchor store of the water work .
i have not been to rock bottom in year . maybe even decade ... is that even possible ? well , either way , it is been awhile . so with my gift certificate i took my brother out for a birthday dinner . a i get older , my tolerance for thing like crowd and youngster get lower and lower . a a result , i told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the waterfront before everyone go out for date night . plus the pirate were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beer and the game.when we arrived , the bar side wa already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table . our server wa very attentive , friendly and helpful . right off the bat we both ordered sampler so we could try all of their beer . we loved the fact that a she approached our table with a full tray of sample our server said , `` i have to go back for the rest . '' in all we were served 10 different beer each ( in 3 oz glass , maybe 4 - i can never tell ) . i got ta say , rock bottom know their beer . i liked more than i did not , and very few were not to my liking . so the $ 6.95 10 beer sampler wa well worth it . during our sampling we indulged on some southwest egg roll . they were okay , but not quite what i expected . the spicy ranch wa top notch , though . a we ran out of beer , we each ordered up a kobe burger . they were both cooked exactly to our liking ( medium ) . and to top off our wonderful evening , the pirate brought home a win ! my only complaint , a a beer drinker , is the cost for a growler . the glass container itself is sold for $ 12.95 . that is the empty price . to me , that is a little ridiculous when east end only charge $ 3 for the bottle and penn brewery $ 5 . paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me . so i walked out empty handed . but it will not deter me from returning .
i just came here with some friend to hang out and get some appetizer , and i have to admit that i wa pretty satisfied with what we got . though i could not find any fried pickle or onion ring on the apps section , there were some blue cheese nacho that really hit the spot . the atmosphere of this seems pretty cool , especially in the pub area .
fish taco were excellent ! ! great brewed beer on tap a well ! ! ! ! ! !
i very much enjoyed my first visit here . i got the turkey meatloaf and it wa really tasty . it is more sausage than turkey . the cheesy mashed potato were excellent . the star of the night wa the appetizer , the artichoke and crab dip . it wa awesome . my only complaint wa i ordered a red ale and they were out . i had the curmudgeon instead and it wa very good , but still .
slow servicebelow average food ill pas
first time i wa here i had chicken quesadilla is and they were bad . we went again last weekend . i had the chicken avacod sandwich . it wa very good . no fat in the chicken . just a mess to eat , but still awesome . also had the chocolate stout cupcake , it wa amazing .
thanks to the staff herefor being so friendly andcool with our whole mess**rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and buster orphaned u
it not bad . i am not into chain kind of place , but if you are with a group that doe not do anything more adventurous , you will do fine here . i vacillated between 2 and 3 star but the house beer i had will make sure i come back from time to time .
went to rock bottom for lunch the other day and wa very pleased . my coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer . the waitress told u that they were not making mini appetizer and gave u a full sized chicken quesadilla . if you have ever had the southwestern egg roll from chili is - the filling tasted like that and i am a big fan ! monday are half off burger day and i tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapeno , pepper jack cheese , pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup . it wa delish ! the ketchup wa so good and the fry were extremely crispy . the price are a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday , it is totally worth it . i think that the quality of food more than make up for it but do not expect for pay under $ 10 for a sit down . i felt that the staff wa very nice and the waitress wa very attentive . the service wa quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour .
rock bottom is a chain brew pub one that , in my opinion , is just `` ok '' . the restaurant is rather large with lot of seating and a pool table . they have many of their own brew that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good . i have had several of their beer and all of them have been forgettable . their food is pretty much like their beer , forgettable . i have had one of their burger and their pizza and they really were not anything to write home about.i feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but i would probably describe them a the chili is of brew pub . if you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite , or at least until the burgatory open !
went here last night to meet folk for a friend is birthday party . docking one star due to a few unfortunate thing that happened , otherwise i 'd be fine giving this place a 3.our waiter wa very attentive and kept our water and soda cup refilled , the food wa decent overall - i had a plain ol ' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and wa pretty comfortable and fun to be in ... you 'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and i 'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.here is where i ran into problem . i 'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since i do my best to pick item on menu that are not , say , 2,000 calorie in one sitting . their website advertises that they make skinny drink ; when i asked my waiter he said it wa possible but that they did not normally do this and that it is a hassle for the people at the bar , so he did not recommend it . then why tell u on your website that you will do it ? ? ? additionally , while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant is ability to handle u lighting candle , apparently there wa a break down in communication ; we never got the candle we had asked for , and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candle available . obviously whatever error occurred wa not the waiter is fault , and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had . on a final note , this is also one of those place where if you ask for a medium rare burger , they will overcook it ; i have started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that i get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.final verdict : go for the brew if you must , and the food is nice enough . i wa admittedly left a little underwhelmed .
mostly come here for the beer and sport . fun place !
nothing special . just like applebee is , chili is or friday . stick to the bar food ( burger , sandwich , pizza , wing and salad ) and you will be okay . this wa our second attempt at trying rock bottom on father day . the first time almost ten year ago . we went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steak . how do you do that on father day ? ! this time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.my wife got and loved the berry bash sangria . she just said it had too much ice in it . our daughter got the root beer float which she love and i started with a mango ice tea , but later switched for a raspberry ice tea a the mango ice tea wa not sweet enough.we started off the the kobe beef slider a our app . it took at least 15 minute to get them . you get three slider and they were very good.my wife got a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchilada a her main entree . she complained about how salty it wa and the fact that there wa no lobster in it at all.our daughter got the kid burger and fry . no surprise there.i ordered the new york strip with mashed potato and it came with green bean a well . my strip wa cooked perfectly and ha a decent taste . longhorn ha a much , much better quality of steak though . the green bean were pretty good and my mashed potato very bland and pretty average . the kitchen sounded like an live episode of hell is kitchen . the waiter were repeatedly asking for order at least 5 to 6 time . the kitchen wa backed up the whole time we were there.on a different note , our waitress susan wa very good . come here for drink and the bar food . skip everything else .
i go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer , so i wa really really excited to have my bridal shower there . my maid of honor reserved the banquet room which wa very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant . my moh and mother said that the person they talked to about reservation and arrangement wa wonderful and easy to get in touch with . my shower wa wonderful , the wait staff wa great and kept everyone is glass full . it started pouring down rain and they let u stay a little longer so my gift would not get wet when taking them out to the car . the only reason this place get 4 star is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home . there wa salmon , chicken , potato , and mac and cheese left over and they told u we could not box it up . not sure why- they can not re-serve it ! it would have just gone to waste ! also , not at all related to the shower , their trivia night is super fun !
southwest egg roll and fish taco . mmmmmmmmm . ohh and the amazing brew !
i am giving 4 star mostly because of the beer ... .large selection & decent price . the food is pretty good , but nothing to rave about . the menu ha a good variety , and everything i have tried ha been good . portion are large . one side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere ... .with several tv is & 2 pool table . it is very wide open with extremely high ceiling . the other side is more for family or people who are not concerned about watching sport . in general , it ha a relaxed atmosphere . i have always had quick & friendly service . i love the whole waterfront area ... .so much to do !
i am not much of a beer drinker , but my fiancee is a major enthusiast , so i agreed to tag along . i am glad i did ! our waitress wa very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection , and helped me to pick one i would love ( the kolsch wa very crisp , light , and drinkable . ) the food wa standard pub fare with a twist , well-executed . my burger wa topped with onion petal and gorgonzola , and cooked to perfection . the waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side , which wa definitely a good choice . my only complaint is that most of the food wa rather heavy , and i spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch . not sure i would make the hour+ trip to pittsburgh again , but if i found myself in the city , i may just stop by .
came with my bf we started with the crab artichoke dip . it wa very greasy and had virtually no crab . the wedge salad wa good and crisp . i had the hazelnut crusted chicken . this ha to be one of the worst dish i have ever had it wa like pancake syrup over breaded chicken . to finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cooky served with hot fudge . well there wa no hot fudge it wa chocolate syrup the ice cream wa so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing .
normally the food is outstanding , no more salted bread stick , but they did bring back the ball park pretzel . not very good , cool to low warm . hard , dense . mango ice tea is wonderful.will see how the chicken come out.to be continued ...
tom and i decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a saturday night . he is a beer buff , and neither of u had ever been there , so we gave it a go.we walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait . we put our name on the list and went shopping around the area . about 25 minute later , our table wa ready . parking wa a cluster since the lot is shared with dave & buster and a karaoke bar called sing sing . tom dropped me off at the door so i could secure our table.our server , jackie , approached me almost immediately and brought two water to the table to start . she wa very attentive and funny , and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant . tom ordered a red ale and to his surprise , did not care for it . jackie gave tom three free sample of beer she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habit . he loved all three , and chose the most bizarre ( and expensive ) beer . jackie switched the red ale to the beer of tom is choice , and charged u for the le expensive beer . very nice of her ! we started out with the ball park pretzel with jalapeno dip . the pretzel came out quickly and they were very fresh , not to mention huge ! we only ate one and took the other to go . very good app though ! tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger , and i got the chicken fried chicken , which wa a pounded chicken breast , breaded and fried , over white cheddar mashed potato with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw . tom is burger came with a small handful of fry , and my meal wa very spread out on my plate , like something wa missing . not very good presentation at all . the food itself wa okay , nothing to write home about . the potato were my favorite part . tom said that his burger wa mediocre.another note : the bathroom are shared with the sing sing karaoke bar that is in the same building , so expect drunk singing woman in the bathroom and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party ... yuck.overall , we might come back for the beer and service , but not for the food . and definitely not to use the bathroom ...
i am a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it is a good option after movie . their nacho is pretty good . i also tried their burger and chicken sandwich and they are good a well . i think the only thing i did't like is the steak taco appetizer . it wa too sour and kinda tasteless .
the cajun pasta i ordered wa just spicy enough to keep me sipping my rock bottom ipa . it may be a chain but i always get that microbrew restaurant feel when i am here . they could upgrade the quality of the server but i have never had a really bad experience with the service .
i really miss the northstar amber but the specialty beer are always good . food is excellent and the service staff is friendly .
so after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the waterfront , we headed to rock bottom for some late night grub . the place wa pretty busy , we had to walk around the bar area for several minute until a nice couple told u they were about to leave and we could have their bar table . a nice a this wa of them it wa awkward standing over them a they finished their drink paid their bill and left . so finally seated i look over the drink and being the huge ipa lover that i am i went with that and it wa indeed a good choice . the hubby had the red ale which wa also rather good.the service wa ok , not the best not the worst . but moving on to more important thing , the food . talk about missing the mark hugely ! i ordered the mini street fish taco . you get four mini taco with a marinated in lime piece of fish , and tomatillo salsa . they were just stroke away from inedible . i love fish taco , i mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish ? the shell were hard and literally split at the bottom when i picked them up . the sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish wa just so overcooked . if i wa not so hungry i would not have eaten them at all ! lesson learn on that.the husband had the bbq chicken pizza . it had bean and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream . my husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza is and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique topping ! for instance , he would usually just say , chicken bbq and cheese , nothing else ! i refused to let him do that this time , because i wa really intrigued in the combination of ingredient on this pie . and boy wa i jealous when it came out . it blew my crappy taco out of the water ! should have stuck with something simple . furthermore i could care le if i come back to this location . the beer were good but hell you can get a decent ipa just about anywhere anymore . and the underwhelming food sealed the deal . i know this is a chain , but it still doe not have to stink ...
the food wa delicious . portion size generous . atmosphere good . our waitress lindy wa outstanding . have nothing but good thing to say . would highly recommend to everyone !
another good meal ... this time the housemade meatloaf . it is a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef . a refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple . served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggie . the server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone ha a bad day once in awhile . service wa prompt just the same . overall good experience .
i have to say that i have only been here when it wa very busy . i found the service fairly quick and any of the food i have had ha been delicious . i went there tonight and there wa an issue with my food . without going into detail , i will say they handled it wonderfully . our waitress mallory wa very kind and she wa quick to fix the problem . i had the salmon for the second time and it wa just a amazing a it wa the first time . i had one beer that is similar to a blue moon and that wa good too . i would go back again !
my husband and i got here a couple time a year . always ( except my veggie today ) get great food at a decent price . i love their side salad ... .. which ha raisin and sunflower seed . burger are great and my husband love their chicken mac and cheese . recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat .
poor service and food . i waited 20 minute at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence . they finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay ... . so i had to wait an additional 15 minute to find someone to pay . yes , i had to try and give them money.on to the important part ... food wa terrible . i had a burger and it wa pathetic .
on a glorious day in the month of may , my love and i stumbled hungrily into rock bottom . ha . just kidding i realized darren w. had not reviewed here so i had to start it cheesy . the rock bottom line : monday for lunch we had awesome service by ashley . we were not rushed and it wa quite . the burger were great and half off . the beer wa very good . we will be returning for sure .
planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off ! service wa extremely helpful , professional , and on point all night . lauren ( one of the manager ) wa reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process . if anyone is looking to plan an event i would highly recommend rock bottom . could not be happier !
i love this restaraunt . rarely have i ever received service like i get here . the food is good , definitely reasonable for the price . the thing that blew me away wa the fact that my steak wa cooked to temperature . this rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality . but the server are fantastic . very attentive , polite and timely . the beer selection is awesome , we always order the sampler . i like having lot of option a far a beverage go . the wait time is not terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night . and they most often call you before the quote time . the desert menu is a little small , but i could probably skip it anyways ; ) the ambiance is good , not to crammed or noisy . they also have outside seating available when the weather is nice i highly recommend this establishment !
i love this place ! great food and the best beer brewed on site ! the bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here .
the staff here is very nice and the set up ha tv all around the family so enjoy mostly all sport , the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the price are pretty reasonable . and most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all time .
good food and large portion . i ordered the veggie burger for $ 8.50 and i loved it ! it is one of the most unique veggie burger i have ever had : a homemade patty of bean , rolled oat and veggie . the chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph . my burger wa more than enough for me to handle and everything wa worth the price . a for drink , i am a complete noob when it come to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste , i could tell it wa very good quality beer . bitter and sweet , with a slight tang . i rarely drink beer but i i am going to , then might a well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.note : there are not too many option for vegetarian . the veggie burger wa pretty good and i 'd recommend it , but other than that , there is also the veggie taco , a few select appetizer , and a few salad from which to choose .
i have never been crazy about the food here , but my friend like it , so i do eat here once in a while . we stopped in last night and i had the chicken finger appetizer with fry . the food wa a little overcooked and nearly tasteless . the ranch dressing wa barely good enough to make up for it . my friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon , which is what she order just about every time she is there . it looked delicious and the portion wa huge . i will be trying this dish next time we are there . we have also had the ball park pretzel in the past , and they are really good . i am giving 4 star because the service wa great , there is outdoor seating , and the berry bash sangria wa delicious ( if expensive ) . we will be back .
every time i have been here the food ha always been delicious and the service ha always been very exceptional . my go to is the laredo burger and the mac n'cheese a a side . they mac n ' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic ! i have had a few other menu option a well that have been superb . the beer on tap are always great . my newest favorite is the first ! pumpkin ale . one thing i really appreciate about rock bottom is that they are not one of these restaurant that try to rush you out when you are done eating . the food come out fast ( which is great when you are starving ! ) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companion there is never any rush . i wa just at rock bottom last night meeting friend for a movie that did not start until 11pm . we got at the restaurant around 7:30 , ordered drink , ate and had a few more drink and then just hung out for about a half hour until it wa time to walk over to the cinema . it wa nice not feeling rushed to leave a soon a we stopped ordering.my only complaint are that sometimes meat end up being cooked a little more than you often ask . medium often turn into medium well , but that is not a huge problem for me . i also do not think the signature cocktail are worth $ 9 , but that is more of a corporate complaint since rock bottom is a small chain . overall i definitely recommend eating here if you are in the waterfront !
the food is standard american fare -- a bit overpriced in my mind -- and the beer range from mediocre to very bad . the kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch . the service is good , but the wait for food or a table can be quite long ( generally 20-30 minute even for just beer and apps ) . i have been to the one at the denver airport a well , but i wa stranded and had free meal ticket , so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from rock bottom it wa . since it is a recognizable national chain , i think of place like this a more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craft-brew experience .
the beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at all . i have tried many thing on the menu , and if you have developed a `` foodie '' palate , do not even bother , because you will be very disappointed . if you feel comfortable with chain restaurant and their lack of innovative touch ( which , nothing wrong with that ! ) you will most likely enjoy rockbottom . the only entree i did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchilada ( minus the repulsive bean and rice ) and the asiago crab dip a an appetizer . otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
this place is quite big with a bar area , dining room area , and patio area . we decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many tv is . they also have dart and two pool table , which i really enjoy . when you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool . i ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat , both of which are brewed by rock bottom . they both tasted delicious and were exactly what i needed for a hot day . my friend ordered the fried chicken entree which came with mashed potato and of course she gave me a few bite since we always share . it wa a pretty delicious meal , but the fried crust fell off a few piece which i am not really a fan of . i ordered the sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried . the salad wa okay i wa expecting more flavor overall , but i did not really get them . it wa a good experience and will most likely be back when i am around the waterfront area .
i am not a fan of chain restaurant typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurant all of the time . the one chain that i can not break from is rock bottom . their beer is always good- a far a their staple go , i really love their white ale . their seasonal ipas have been good and my favorite seasonal of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout ( ... yes , it tasted a good a it sound ; they had it last year around christmas ) and their smoky bbq brown ale ( tasted like summer , complemented bbq amazingly ; they had it this past summer , i bought a growler of it lol ) . a far a their food go , i typically stay away from the appetizer . $ 10 and up is a little too pricey for me a far a appetizer go . i have had their southwestern roll and they were good but not worth $ 10 . almost every time i go i order the baja chicken sandwich . it is my favorite chicken sandwich ! so good . the chicken is actually grilled ( which go for all of their chicken sandwich ) and i love the charred flavor that it ha . the bun is soft but sturdy and doe not fall apart while eating the sandwich , the sauce is amazing , the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least ... there is a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich . mhm ! i love it . my boyfriend usually get the hickory bbq bacon chicken sandwich and love it a well . another item i always get ... their apple coleslaw . i have yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant . so simple , yet oh so good . they also recently changed their fry and these are much better than their old one . their side salad are awesome a well . they are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seed , raisin , half of a hard boiled egg ( which i give to the boyfriend ) , chopped cucumber and tomato and crouton . yum ! i usually order the same thing every time i go . i steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless . which turned me off to trying new item there . plus i am just too in love with the baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else . service is always great , the bartender are friendly ... i love this place . ask about their rock bottom reward !
be careful . the server can not pay attention to save their life , and the management care even le . i want to make sure people know how careless the management is , particularly mark who seems to let his staff run around .
i always enjoy rock bottom . standard beer on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually ha a hit a well . i prefer the bar seating a to the dining room , but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of u without kiddos . nacho , nacho , nacho . truly the best in the area . great burger , chili and salad . really ... i do not think i have had a bad meal here . nice outdoor seating in the summer . this is a great place to watch a game or just hang out . iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold . i know they have other cocktail here , but i can not order them at a beer place . i have seen them and they do look good , but i am stuck to the beer selection . they have a great happy hour and special throughout the week . service is always great whether there are two or 10 of u .
this is a `` okay '' place to eat . the food is nothing special . i guess what they have going for them is the beer . order the guacamole for the starter which wa okay but for $ 8.50 and the portion wa not worth it . rice ( cajun taco ) wa not cooked well . would i go there again `` maybe '' . if your into beer and watching the game , then yeah go there .
ball park pretzel-would eat again . i came to rock bottom , looking for a great beer . full of hop , that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction . i then opened the menu , scanned looking for those select bar item to pair with my great beer . i saw an extensive list of item , from chicken finger to salad . i noticed a ball park pretzel , with a jalapeño cheese dip . i wa blown away , the fact that i got 2 pretzel amazed me . i ordered within 25 minute of seating . my pretzel hit the table within minute . the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my sens . but i knew we could step this shit up , i asked for mustard . and what do you know . grey poupon dijon mustard is in front of my eye . i combined that shit and life evolved . i went to heaven , it took me 35 minute to write this review because i took a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence . good look rock bottom , keep up the good work .
we have been going to rock bottom for sevesrl year and love it ! it is our go to place , when we want a nice meal , in a nice atmosphere , with good service ! we have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visit but for the most part , service is excellent and the food is consistent ! after leaving another restaurant ( just trying to do something new for a celebration ) because of poor service , we were greeted and seated in a few second ! our server wa at our table within second even though she had a large ( 10 to 12 guest ) group at the table near u . we had our drink in minute and were checked on twice within 5 minute . our food came out rather quickly and wa delicious ! our server wa very attentive and social . a usual , a save by our go to place ! i know we will retun here again !
my husband and i went to rock bottom brewery last night for the first time and we had a wonderful experience ! our server , amanda , wa very attentive , and wa able to make several good beer recommendation to my husband . my husband said that his burger wa the best one he 'd ever had , and my pizza wa delicious ! price were not too bad either , especially considering how amazing the food and the service wa . rock bottom is now on our list of favorite local restaurant and we will definitely be visiting it again in the future !
nice enough chain restaurant . have ordered the fish taco appetizer and the dinner entree of cajun fish taco which come with black bean and rice . both are ok , though i think i 'd order something else next time a i am pretty picky about fish taco . the appetizer taco were rather dry . the cajun taco were much better but executed oddly . they come in 2 shell -- an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell . why might i ask ? why add extra calorie for something that seems so unnecessary and doe not add to the dish in any way . oh , well . can not speak about beer here a i am not a beer drinker.the space is pleasant and our server wa efficient even if the meal wa not the quickest to come to our table even though it wa not busy.would i revisit ? probably ; it wa decent enough with many other menu option . keep in mind , however , that there are many option nearby worthy of a visit .
standard issue rock bottom . we ordered the nacho ... .they could have easily served 6 people . i have never seen a more massive platter of food . bar service wa okay ... guy working there wa nice to talk to about sport .
on a friday i went to rock bottom with some friend for their happy hour which take place from 4-6 . our server wa a spunky brunette who wa very attentive and even let u sample a many beer a we liked until deciding . i ultimately decided on the pom-berry cosmo which wa excellent . i also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing . during happy hour it is only $ 5 and you get two big pretzel served with this delicious cheese dip . my friend got the nacho , the quesadilla , and the artichoke cheese dip . everything wa very tasty .
for this occasion i wa with my girl , we were looking for a place to have a good lunch . we looked around and chose rock bottom , we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves . the server wa a very nice person and wa very attentive . she when over the special and took our drink order . going through the menu one thing that caught my eye wa the bbq brisket stuffed burger . that just sounded so good . unfortunately the reality did not match the idea of the burger . the favor of the bbq never came through and the smoked gouda flavor wa none existent . it wa like having a standard old boring burger . i wa very disappointed . for $ 14 , i would have expected a lot more flavor . i would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor .
went to rock bottom at the waterfront over the weekend with 10 adult and 3 child in high chair . service wa good , efficient , and fast . i enjoyed a good bowl of tortilla soup and an order of buffalo wing . both very good . from the table , i heard rave review of the ball park pretzel the other meal including a 2 alarm burger , a few classic burger cooked medium a requested , mac n cheese , and lobster and shrimp enchilada . a very good experience .
my visit here are generally pretty consistent . i love getting the beer sampler even though i have drank all the beer twice over . i would not say i have a favorite dish here yet but the food wa always generally good . i guess one thing that stick out is the chicken mac and cheese and the reuben . when i go here though , i am going for the beer more than the food . definitely worth a trip for dinner .
first , i have to say that i have been here twice in the past few month , and each time wa with a very large group ( one group of 20 , one group of over 30 ) on a weekend evening and i am thoroughly impressed with the friendly , efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate group . whether increasing the number of diner at the last minute or providing separate check , they are flawless . lot of other restaurant could learn from them . impressively , even with providing separate check to such large group , they chose not to add gratuity ( and we obliged with good tip ) , l managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time , and processed payment of the check in no time at all . bravo to this restaurant is management and service staff , it is top notch.that being said , the food and beer aint all that bad either ! fish & chip , chicken mac'n cheese , salmon bite , guacamole and the maker is mark burger are all quite good , a are the beer ( the kölsch is my favorite ! ) .
there are few local restaurant a popular a this place , the food is consistently good and the service always great . i meet people regularly at the bar , we usually have dinner but lately that is not always the case . the biggest complaint is that it seems the chef is intent on putting black pepper or some type of hot spice in all menu item .
overpriced . food is ok , but way overpriced . quantity are small ... .much smaller than the picture in the menu . the beer is average . but yes , you guessed it , that is overpriced too .
it is been a couple year since i first reviewed rock bottom , and while i still do not love the place they have definitely improved since then . they admittedly still are not my first choice food-wise because , by design , they are a pretty generic eatery for the most part , especially compared to other option in the area . their local brew are really the only thing that set them apart from other place in the waterfront , and pittsburgh ha so many brewery and so forth now that even that is not the biggest draw anymore.that said , their brew are usually quite good and worth trying . plus , they are improving in term of service and quality of food , and that deserves a mention . sure , i may think their menu of burger , pizza and american eats is pretty average , but i also think the quality of the dish is improving . for example , my burger are no longer coming to me overcooked , and a a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of topping and a dry meat patty . some dish are even more memorable now ; i actually really like their veggie burger , which is packed full of flavor that even i , a known carnivore , can appreciate . and their fresh pretzel and dip ? absolutely amazing - exactly what you 'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven . i wa especially impressed during my last visit by a server named mark , who wa incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drink and keep u updated . he never said a negative word and wa quick to correct any mistake or problem that popped up during the night . if rock bottom hire more people like him , there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place , i guarantee it.add in the fact that this is one of a small handful of place that accepts reservation in the waterfront - a major plus when planning big outing with friend in the area ! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie , shopping , etc . for food and drink . and for that , rock bottom is earned another star in my book .
wa hoping for a great end of a day experience , but ... ... thing happen . waitress seemed to have forgotten about u , entree came out prior to our appetizer . entree of fish & chip wa a major disappointment , fish wa soggy and the chip were cold and grainy.starters were comp'ed but i doubt we 'd go back . sad because it ha the potential to be a home run hitter . two star and that is it .
rock bottom : a cautionary yelper is tale.you might say , `` i have never heard of rock bottom , there is no way that they are a chain restaurant . '' beer ? apps ? bros ? sound like a good time , but be careful or you will end up on the rock bottom.after a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a buffalo wild wing , we were finally seated . we could feel the tension from other diner that something wa not right . the manger wa running around apologetically and the food wa casually sunbathing under the heat lamp . we immediately ordered a few apps but just like got , and now our watch begins.we waited and waited to finally receive the saddest , tiniest plate of food with bloated chain restaurant price . the food wa uninspired , tired , and ordinary . the only reason why i am giving them 2 star is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20 % of our meal due to the terrible service . so if you have decided to take a seat at rock bottom , take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain .
great bar . great atmosphere . great food . cool place to be.definitely one of those place you could keep going back just because it is so chill and it is a great place for friend to just enjoy some drink and eat some good food . nothing too too spectacular by any mean but satisfies the taste bud . their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant , in my opinion . the nacho can be split among 4-5 people easy . lot of topping and yummy all around .
while this is certainly not my first meal at rock bottom , this is my first meal in a year or two . the wait wa minuscule , and the greeter wa pleasant . a always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivore , the mother in law and i decided to tie the feed bag on at rb . our server matt wa easy to work with and informative . i started off with the tortilla soup . spicy and thick it went down easy enough . however let me say that the price at $ 3.50 wa rather steep for the serving size . did somebody say ouch ! ! thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steak ' with fruit ( cantaloupe , melon , and grape ) and steamed broccoli and at $ 6.75 each , i think i wa 'buffaloed ' if you get my drift . the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced piece of ... . hmmm . they say that kid say the darnedest thing well thing one noticed that his steak wa very very gristly , and thing two noticed that his wa rather dry . not the best dinner they have eaten . they say you get what you pay for or not ! ! my meal consisted of the chicken bacon mac & cheese and at $ 14.75 i had no complaint . it wa filing hot and load with chicken and bacon . how can anything be wrong with that much bacon ! ! ! the final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $ 13.95 my mother in law wa sated . over all this meal wa a wash . if anyone from rock bottom corporate read this ... you may seriously want to rethink you portion size . a you know i vote with my foot and dollar , and neither will be there again any time soon ! !
this is another one of my favorite place that had deteriorated dramatically . corporate decided to get rid of the core beer and the beer now suck . the menu ha gone from something for everyone to a couple of overpriced entree and a bunch of small plate that are ok but not great . the service ha also suffered tremendously . we are abandoning this restaurant.i do not expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer . in the past , on night when the pirate were playing out of town , the bar and the restaurant would be packed . last night , it wa only slightly busy . you can usually tell when an eatery is suffering by the amount of staff on a given night and the condition of the bathroom . the staff wa overwhelmed and the bathroom were filthy and in serious need of repair . ala , i do not think that rock bottom will still be in business in six month . hopefully , if that happens , black rock bar & steak house will find it way into pittsburgh .
i love rock bottom . i do not frequent the restaurant side of rb a much a i do singsing , but the food come from rb . i order practically the same thing every time ( bacon mac 'n cheese , brewery nacho , and a beer ... usually an ipa or a manhattan ) and the last two time i wa at rb , the food wa disappointing : it wa cold and unappetizing , my manhattan sucked , and the service wa worse . the food is always better over at singsing for some reason ... even if they do come from the same place ! i wa craving the mac 'n cheese , so i went down to pick some up . i had a gift card , so i figured i wa not out any money if the food sucked . i saw that there wa a new menu , so i sat down to order . i got the street food quesadilla , bacon mac 'n cheese , and beer battered onion ring . i also ordered a homemade root beer and a few sample of the house beer.everything wa amazing ! it came out hot and tasted awesome . they have a new head chef and it show . i wa floored ... the new street food option are fun and tasty . they are unique and different ... not something you 'd find at any restaurant in the area.the service wa good . my waitress wa named liz and she certainly wa on point . she even helped me find a beer after i wa sorely disappointed by the ipa offering ... which wa weird . i always thought the house brew were tasty and fun , no matter their style or make . i am an ipa girl , but i would happily drink anything that came from their tap . i wa disappointed in the offering , but i ended up settling on the pale ale that wa quite tasty.in the end , if you were turned off by rock bottom before , i 'd definitely recommend going back to check out the street food and new menu offering . service ha dramatically improved , food quality ha improved , and i wa thrilled .
stopped in for dinner an bellied up to the bar . the bar tender wa quick to get me a beer ( the 3 pepper ale which wa really good ) but after that i wa totally ignored . tried to get the attention of the two bartender for about a half hour while nursing my beer . they seemed to be more interested in changing dollar for quarter and washing glass . i got feed up , finished my beer , paid my tab and went to uno is . glad i did ... got great service and my meal came quickly.verdict : sit at the bar for a beer if that is what you want but if you are hungry and want dinner take your chance at a table .
for a chain , it is better atmosphere than you would expect . the menu option all sound delicious , but the food quality is not great . just mediocre .
service is good , staff is friendly and knowledgeable . beer and cocktail are good a well . food ... not so much . my boyfriend and i shared the jalapeno pretzel appetizer which wa pretty good , but our entree ... . disappointing . i got the baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger . both were super dry . i could not even finish half of mine . he had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down . if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling . i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me . for a side , i requested the seasonal veggie ( trying to be healthier ) and wa told it is a squash mixture - great i love summer squash ! i received a poorly seasoned burger . the bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement . it wa topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd . my `` squash '' side wa lacking squash . instead all squash wa replaced by pepper ... which i can not eat.our server wa nice . the beer wa simple . with new brewery and restaurant popping up in and around homestead , perhaps rb should reconsider their flavor .
apps were good , service wa average , and the certified angus beef tip were awful . they were severely overcooked and the sauce they were in had no flavor . the picture on the menu made it appear you get a good amount of tip . however , i wa given only 4 tip , which in the end i wa thankful for , because if i had any more , i would have had to rest my jaw for a couple day due to the extreme toughness and amount of chewing required to swallow those flavorless tip .
great american style bar food with quite a lot to pick from the both the food and drink menu . they are also great at accommodating large group and these are one of the few place that allow you to call ahead to reserve a spot . been here plenty of time with my group and we enjoyed it every time .
overpriced . food is ok , but way overpriced . quantity are small ... .much smaller than the picture in the menu . the beer is average . butbyes
i am a fan of rock bottom . this is my 2nd time here and i can say i am a fan . we went on a saturday night after a day at sandcastle . the wait wa 45-60 min for a table of 5 which wa to be expected on a saturday evening . our server wa not the best in my opinion . she wa very friendly and some what attentive but it definitely took awhile to place our order in for our drink , appetizer , and meal . since we were all hungry , i ordered u the nacho . they were awesome . very happy and pleased with that selection . my sister ordered pretzel which were pretty good , but the clearly had too much salt on them . the cheese dip that came with the pretzel however wa awesome . definetly pleased with our selection.we placed our order , which came out in a timely fashion . everyone wa pleased . the price for the meal were about average for everything that you got . i got the the margarita pizza which wa pretty good . my wife got jalpeno burger with fry . my son got the kid pizza . my sister and her husband got the seafood taco with shrimp and crab i believe . the best part of this place is that they brew their own beer here . everyone got a honey beer ( can not remember the exact kind ) but it wa 7.75 for 25oz which wa a fair price i think . all in all , it def a place worth going .
good beer , food and service . arrived on a wednesday night for business and sat at the bar . bartender wa attentive and nice . food wa great . i had the bison prairie burger . it wa cooked perfectly and the flavor and fry were great . i will be coming here again on my next business trip .
the food is always plentiful , the atmosphere lively , the service friendly , and even though it is always busy , i rarely have to wait for a table . if you are a nacho fan , this is the place ! often , i just make it my appetizer , salad , and meal . yes , it is that big . even though i am not a big beer drinker , i enjoy their sampler , and i love their cider ; it had just the right amount of kick .
came to this place last night after shopping ! food wa pretty good ! service wa good . sat outside . nice space !
they did a good job accommodating a large group . mac n cheese with chicken and bacon wa good . in house beer were moderate and selection wa limited . good service , franchise-ish ambiance , nothing extraordinary but easy enough .
loved the american blonde and gram is oat soda ipa . good service . egg roll were very good . our bar tender wa very attentive and helpful in selecting the beer .
if your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option . they have a nice seasonal selection and it is all tap which i prefer . i also like that most of the seating is booth . on my visit the service wa lack luster . i have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skill left much to be desired . i went with a beer sampler . it wa nice being able to try everything they have . i of course went with the pumpkin beer . for my main dish i had stuffed pepper which i honestly enjoyed . they had a great flavor . my only issue is the rice that came with it wa a bit under cooked . if service wa better and my rice wa cooked i would have given this place a solid 4 star but that unfortunately wa not the case on this particular visit .
i am visiting homestead this week for some work-related training . rock bottom wa recommended by the receptionist at my hotel , and i am so glad it wa ! i have been there twice already and will go back before i leave in a few day . i sat at the bar during both of my visit , and the bartender were both very nice ... bob during the day and paul at night . the pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome . like other reviewer stated , the nacho are great ! i think the best part wa that everyone wa very friendly . other customer seated at the bar were eager to chat , which is so nice when you do not know anyone in the area ! great place ! thanks for the hospitality !
came here on a saturday night . waited over an hour for a table for 2 , but enjoyed some great beer from the bar while waiting . ordered the calamari appetizer to start which wa very good . my fish and chip entree wa cold , but my boyfriend 2 am burger wa phenomenal .
very disappointing menu . pseudo mexican and south of the border fare . i had the beef tip slider . what a ridicule offering . each one ( 2 on a plate ) had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong 3 '' bun . it wa taken back to the kitchen , after i complained , and a thin sliver now appeared . the only thing good about this experience , the waiter wa nice ! a the raven said , `` never , never more . ''
we stopped in to grab bite to eat before we went to improv . my wife and i got the bacon chicken mac & cheese . it wa absolutely delicious right down to the last bite . we raved about it all night long . our friend got a burger and asked for it well done . it came out medium . so she sent it back . the manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friend check . pretty great service . she loved the burger , and said it wa one of the best she ha had . i had the beer sampler and i liked all six beer . they were good . i would recommend this place and if we are down that way i will definitely go back .
great selection of beer especially the seasonal one ! you will not be disappointed . the jalapeño pretzel are dope !
i am very disappointed to say this place ha gone down hill . while my boyfriend and i use to really enjoy coming here , the food ha gotten considerably worse . they have taken many thing off the menu we use to enjoy , such a the pretzel stick with beer cheese , and replaced them with frozen ballpark pretzel and nacho cheese . tonight i ordered a steak salad , of which the steak wa good , but there wa nothing on the salad that wa listed on the menu . not to mention the whole place smell smell like dirty mop water . the beer is still very good , that is why still gave them 2 star .
we were a party of four . my wife and i ordered the stuffed pepper . it wa very spicy with some serious zip . however , it wa delicious . my youngest son had the chicken enchilada . he thought that those were the best that he ever had . my oldest son had the chicken mac-n-cheese . he thought that it wa very good . we all shared the calamari and jalapeno appetizer -- very spicy , but very good . we also had the buffalo wing appetizer . the sauce wa very good , but the wing were ok . the brownie dessert wa a little disappointing . the brownie were dry . i also had the key lime dessert . it wa ok . the service wa outstanding . the atmosphere wa vibrant and enjoyable . we will definitely return the next time that we are in pittsburgh .
we stopped into rock bottom for a late dinner . the place wa hopping-the bar side and the restaurant side . we chose to dine on the restaurant side . there were a lot of great choice on the menu . i chose the grilled chicken sandwich which had barbecue sauce , bacon , cheddar cheese , pickle , lettuce , tomato , and red onion . the chicken it self had a great grilled flavor . i think it wa good enough to eat plain . the barbecue sauce wa smokey with a hint of sweetness . the pickle added a tangyness . it wa a huge sandwich . it wa served with fry but they were a little soft . they needed a few more minute of cooking . i only ate half of my sandwich so i would have room for dessert . they have a couple of smaller dessert that are served in mason jar . then they have a few that are larger that you could share with 2pr 3 people . i ordered the cheesecake with caramel and toffee . yum ! ! ! ! it wa the perfect ending to a good meal .
ergh , this place . i hate giving bad review but on my latest visit , i should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here . naturally , i am not a stranger to this chain , understand it is a chain , but the past visit here wa just not good.came with my brother on a sunday after a driving lesson . we were hungry and this wa his way of paying for gas money . we were seated in the dining area . every time we are seated in the dining area it is a bad experience . on the bar side you get entertainment , the beer flights/draft special are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.it started off with the soft drink . i am not a pop drinker so when i want a simple diet pepsi i expect it not to taste funky [ and yes , i prefer the weird twang of diet drink to sugar in a glass taste of regular ] . there wa incorrect carbonation , whether they were running out [ i suspect this ] , no ice [ lukewarm ] or they had just hooked up a new box [ unlikely ] . i sent it back.my brother got a burger which he said wa fine , it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied . i tried to steal a few of his fry , which were a failure . they tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [ a full mouth of starch ] , and were barely crispy enough . so abandon plan . on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken . first of all , the pasta wa crispy ? , really ? , it wa not a cheese sauce , it wa pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in parmesan and smothered in breadcrumb . and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing . sigh . the chicken wa pushed to the bottom of the pan , which my brother tasted because i wa turned off my this version of my favorite dish , and said it wa cooked properly . a small save ? again - i sent it back after about 3 bite . the waitress came back asking if i wanted a box , i told her to take it away . she did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check , which i did not see a my brother paid for it while i used the restroom , i hope they did not charge u for the pop drink ... . needle to say , i came home hungry . honestly , if you come , come for drink and a salad , they do not screw those up . everything else , avoid .
i have been coming here a lot lately and the food is consistently good . their burger are great ( especially the 2:00 am burger ) and the staff is always friendly . i have not tried too many of their beer but the food will keep me coming back !
wa only here for drink so this is not a reflection on food . tried their standard flight and greatly enjoyed the xm @ s but nothing else stood out . also had the gentleman , holly is mistletoe and lively . the gentleman wa good in my opinion . 2 out of 8 beer impressed me and above standard for my taste while the others were below standard when it come to craft beer . again this is my opinion . i have a wide range of style i enjoy but ipas are a solid choice for me . pricing for flight wa excellent at $ 6 for 6 4oz . tasters.the service wa lackluster . myself and two friend were sat and the waitress took my order and the other man but ignored the girl that wa with u and walked off without even asking her if she would like anything . she wa a bit put off to say the least . we tracked the waitress down and she apologized but the rest of the stay wa a bit awkward . i hear the food is very good and will return to try it and adjust my review accordingly .
a friend and i stopped in to rock bottom brewery before a movie on a cold thursday . it wa a short hike from the theater , but i am not cold tolerant , and wa glad of the warm , comfortable restaurant interior . it wa pretty empty ( my favorite ) , and we were ushered to a booth , which wa roomy and comfortable . our server wa friendly , attentive , and made great recommendation . the beer were very tasty ! even though we were starving , our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nacho if we planned to get dinner . good tip ! ! ! the half order of nacho is piled on to a traditional dinner plate , and it wa plenty of appetizer for 2 people . my friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potato and slaw . she seemed to enjoy it . i got the veggie pizza with feta , which wa good , but i think i would have been happier with something else . there wa no fatal flaw in the pizza , i think i wa stuck eating bread with grilled veggie and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that wa entirely my fault . overall , this wa a positive experience . it ha a `` chain '' feel ( because it is a chain ) , but i would go back and recommend it to others . it is for foodie ? nope . it is amazingly original ? nope . but it is good food , good beer , good service , and a fair price . definitely .
first bad experience at this place . double swiss burger wa a tasteless a they could make . i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt . instead of caramelized onion , they added raw onion . they should check the quality of jalapeños they use , it wa not hot at all . they also forgot to add mayo.ohh and they took 50 minute to prepare this burger , and we missed our movie at amc . the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything wa okay . will not visit again .
saturday night , valentine is weekend around 7 pm - larger table sat quicker from what i could tell when we were waiting . i wa with one other person and we waited upwards of 50 minute for a table . when we were finally sat it wa by the door where it wa really drafty . it wa below freezing out , and we were both really cold . the food wa great though when it came , and it somewhat warned u up . we ordered the tortilla soup , nacho , diablo pizza , and 2 am burger . the soup wa delicious . i am itching to have another bowl already . i also tried their darkest beer that had hint of cacao and peanut butter . i am not a beer fan , but i really liked it . our waitress wa extremely nice a well . we were comped 20 something dollar when we did not even complain or say anything . it wa a nice surprise when we got our bill . i will definitely be back .
the first time i experienced the rock bottom brewery wa in downtown chicago . it wa wonderful ! i think i went back the next night because i had such a good experience . it is pretty much always packed around happy hour/dinner time because it is a great spot . the pittsburgh location doe not quite compare . the actual layout , food , service , etc. , is average . i ordered the bison burger last night and it wa pretty good . but , it wa a bit dry and it did not seem like they put much effort into it . honesty , when i received my food , it reminded me of being at a place like applebee is of chili is . they were out of mac and cheese because they had had a busy night . i did not mind that at all because i had tried the mac and cheese before ; you should give it a try if you have not . the waitress wa great . she checked in often to make sure we were comfortable . the menu is large . you are sure to find something you want to try . but it is a brewery , so the option are mostly variation of bar food . it is a cool place to go if you want to eat late and have a decent sized group with you .
we waited for almost an hour , while group smaller and larger , who had arrived both before and after u , streamed in and out . when we checked on our table status , they only replied `` you have 19 minute '' to wait . i guess it did not matter that i could see ton of open table if they have some sort of seating timer . once we were seated , our waiter wa quick but that is just about the extent of anything nice i have to say . the other folk in our party mentioned that the burger were pretty good ; however , my cuban cristo wa a mess . it had too much batter and wa fried too long , resulting in a greasy , brick of a sandwich . and , for a brewery , i wa extremely disappointed by the small size of their beer list . overall , it wa a mediocre experience with forgettable food . i will not be going back .
rock bottom is a decent larger sports/brew pub seating is at a premium on weekend evening , prepare to wait an hour to be seated at a table or try your luck scurrying against others a a high-top becomes available in the bar.the food is average , nothing extraordinary ... we did get the sausage filled pretzel bite , they had little or no sausage in half of them ( should have gotten the ball park pretzel ) they do offer a drink and wine selection but beer is limited to house brew only .
we got here at the last minute last night before the kitchen closed , there were five of u , and we got right in and had awesome service . we tried two beer flight so we could have the entire beer menu . the flight are priced exceptionally well . we had the nacho for an appetizer , which were good but not the best i have ever had . i had the brewer is cobb , which ha always been amazing at every rock bottom i have ever been to and an extraordinary amount . my husband had the beef tip , which tasted good but did not have a lot of meat . it left him wanting more . the mashed potato and onion straw paired with the tip were good though . the atmosphere wa great , it wa clean , and our server wa friendly and attentive . very happy with the experience .
i had my baby shower here . the space very nice , staff friendly , and everyone loved the food , especially the chicken mac n cheese ! everyone is still raving about it !
the experience wa different the second time around . we asked for a booth and got one right away . when we sat down , the waitress came fast and serve our drink and appetizer fast . the food wa great until the steak and shrimp came with the broccoli . it wa not good , the broccoli wa burnt bad and i ask medium well and they sent it bloody . my boyfriend is bison burger wa not that tasty either he sent it back . they sent the burnt broccoli back and i got a great salad , the steak had to go all the way to well done , but i believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred . so the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else , he did not and he asked me how he could make it better , i asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked . he apologized and actually looked out with discounting the meal and gave u fresh spinach dip , which i enjoyed . i will not return but the customer service wa awesome and i will not say do not go , but know what to order and what to watch out for when ordering !
very disappointed with this place . a lot of people standing around , table and menu sticky , the food wa fucked ! ! sent my pathetic bruschetta chicken back because it wa the size of a chicken nugget with one giant stem of broccoli . do not come here to eat . 2 star because the beer wa good .
although the proximity to my house add convenience a a factor in going to rock bottom , the food is le than desirable . the beer there is great , it is a fairly clean establishment with a good wait staff , but the food is awful . i ordered the quesadilla appetizer , and for $ 10.59 i got 4 mini tortilla , not toasted at all , with some melted cheese and chicken . no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream . nothing . then i wa hoping the pizza i ordered would sort of redeem our experience , i got their `` hot '' style pizza since i like spicy food . the small pizza probably had 8 jalapeños worth of pepper , and then some sauce and cheese . it wa so underwhelming . i wish the food could match the quality of their beer . real bummer .
my husband and i were fan of the denver rock bottom when we lived in colorado , so we decided to have a date night at the pittsburgh location a few week ago.they were very crowded , but we got a reservation on opentable and were able to skip the line . we arrived a few minute early , but they were able to seat u when we got there . the beer is consistently good here -- i went with the fire chief red ale , and my husband tried both one of the cask strength beer and an ipa . i ordered the bacon chicken mac n ' cheese , and it wa a good a i remembered . my husband is steak wa overdone , but the server were very apologetic ( they offered to replace it , and ended up comping it ) and he said it wa seasoned well . for dessert , we split the mason jar bourbon pecan pie , and it wa delicious , with a really delicious ice cream on top.this location may not have quite lived up to our expectation from the original , but i 'd be happy to end up here again if i am in the area .
a group of eight of u came here because burgatory could not seat u ( big surprise there ) and none of u had been at this location before so we were willing to give it a shot . they were able to seat u , not at the same table but at two adjacent table . we were flexible and more than happy to take that.i had the bourbonzola burger . it wa not the best burger i had ever had , but it certainly wa not the worst . it satisfied the craving i had and that wa really all i expected.the reason i am giving this place a four star is the beer . i had the high-level ipa and it wa fantastic . rock bottom is know for it beer and they did not disappoint . everyone in our group that had beer wa impressed.do not go to rock bottom necessarily expecting the best food you have ever had and you will not be disappointed with the experience . what you can do though is go expecting some pretty damn good beer . do that and you will not be disappointed .
food wa very good and reasonably priced . had great draft choice . i would recommend going early especially on the weekend or sit in the bar area . very crowded and noisy
i have been coming to rock bottom for many year and am a loyal member of their `` mug club '' , which , if you come more than once , you should sign up for because membership come with a few nice perks.rock bottom brew some of their own beer with a nice variety of amber , red , and ipas . typically when i am here i like to sit at the bar or in one of the high top near the bar where you can seat yourself . if weather permit they also have a nice sized patio where you can also dine.usually i am here to share appetizer and my go to is the ballpark soft pretzel with the cheese dip . they also serve some pretty good nacho . when ordering from the menu i have found the grilled chicken bbq sandwich to be a huge hit . this is one delicious sandwich . price are reasonable , service is typically good , and the beer is flowing . nice option when in the waterfront area .
if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom . slow service , horrible , horrible food . wa served freezing cold enchilada and pizza . the enchilada were supposed to be chicken and had two tiny strip of chicken and i am talking minuscule . rice wa still cold when it wa served a second time a half hour later . manager apologized and waitress offered u something while we waited for our food for the second time . i do not know whose fault it wa , but there are clearly some problem in house . i will take the blame for ordering chicken enchilada at a brewery but wow , they were so horrid !
i am not someone that is mechanically inclined , so i can not say for sure that the deal i got wa a good one . but that said alan and the crew at master muffler certainly appears to have done a great job fixing my car to a degree better than i expected and at a price much lower than i wa expecting . and with a great warranty on their work i feel comfortable knowing that if there is a problem i will be covered . i would absolutely recommend them to all my friend .
i have a little bit of mechanical knowledge , but not enough to land me a job a a mechanic . i try to do a good bit of my own work to save on the repair bill and to avoid unscrupulous mechanic . i called a handful of shop to get a quote to replace an exhaust manifold gasket and bolt on my 05 grand cherokee . alan ( owner ) quoted me $ 250 per side ( i have the 5.7 v8 , so there are 2 side ) to fix it . sure enough , it wa $ 250 out the door . alan is a great guy that know his stuff . if it doe not need to be fixed , he will tell you it doe not need to be fixed . but , if it doe need to be fixed , it really doe need fixing . he even checked on a couple of other thing and made some recommendation for other specialty shop for project i plan on doing on this jeep , which he did not have to do . i chose to give master a shot after my normal go-to shop in monroeville did not return my call seeking a quote for the exhaust manifold . some of the review on google for master are unfair , with the chief complaint being a misunderstanding of personality . if you want to question what the mechanic tell you need to be done , fine . just make sure you know what you are talking about . if you have zero mechanical knowledge , do not tell the mechanic how to do their job . alan will not blow smoke up your dress and hold your hand . if you want your car fixed , take it to master . thanks again , alan , for giving me the opportunity to boast on the jeep forum about only paying $ 250 for a repair that many have shelled out $ 1k+ to fix ! you are my new go-to shop for our vehicle . ( if you are curious a to their hour , i wa there a little after 7am . they are first come , first serve . ) do not be an idiot and expect your car to be fixed 5 minute after pulling into the lot . oh , and do not park in front of the garage door like a tool !
terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact . i towed my vehicle to master muffler in the evening . the owner called me at 645 am the next day and gave me attitude for leaving it in his parking lot . he told me he would not work on the vehicle and that i had to pick it back up by the end of the day . i said this wa a secondary vehicle and i asked if he could be fixed at his earliest convenience , he said `` it doe not work like that '' . never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .
good club for a good laugh . high food price ( most comedy club are ) , 2 item min . the food wa le than stellar . i wouldve enjoyed burger king more . service wa decent , i believe the waiters/waitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiters/waitresses . i get grouchy when my glass is sitting empty for more than 2 min .
they have good act coming around here , and often give out free ticket , particularly ine summer . i have never actually paid full price for a ticket here . the two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though ... i do not mind the requirement so much , but the quality is not good and the price are high . our four item total came to about $ 30 ( two appetizer and two beer ) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the server are not even very friendly . also beware ... they have a lot of rule here . they will not seat till the whole party is there ; if you get dinner reservation everyone in the party ha to order dinner , automatic gratuity added to the check , etc . etc.the `` box office '' is also weird ... you get your ticket at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot ... then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the worker are just sitting right there , so i do not get the whole hoopla with the window.all in all though , the seat are comfy enough , the atmosphere is pretty nice , and the act are good .
i always enjoy a good comedy club and though i am a loyal helium fan , i got ta give prop to the improv near pittsburgh . they chose a great location , with surrounding restaurant of all genre and fun bar and shopping . we bought ticket to see a comedian i had never heard of ( he wa decent ) for $ 25 each with a two item purchase minimum . i really dislike that rule but you can not really get around it . the only thing i did not like , aka hated , wa having to wait in line outside before the show started . it wa freeeeezing ! they should put heater outside . seriously .
came here to see charlie murphy . parking wa nightmare . i would expect nothing le on a saturday night.the 15 minute wait to get inside wa torture . they need to implement a system where if you purchased ticket in advance you do not have to wait outside . once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.seating is first come first serve.the server wa pretty quick to take our order . i misread the menu description and did not realize my bbq sandwich came with cheese . i do not eat cheese , and had send my order back . the waiter wa gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minute . i have never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich , maybe it is a northern thing . we got our check quickly , and without issue .
i am huge snl fan , so naturally if someone who is been in the cast is touring , i will come here to see them . some have been really great ... jim breuer . some have been ( surprisingly ) very bad ... .tracy morgan . but it is always been a pleasant experience at the venue . there is not a bad seat in the house and it is small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage . beware if you sit in the very front , you know what is going to happen ! a couple downside ... . waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter . the lobby is so small you are forced to wait outside until the first show start or the first show let is out . and if you want a good seat , you may be waiting in line for a while . burr ! the two drink minimum . i kinda get why they do it , to make money , of course . but this mean they jack up the price of watered down drink . better to stick with beer and wine at these place . no frou frou drink for me ! also , a to be expected , the food is not that great . in a perfect foodie world , place that served food would make it fantastic ! since that is not going to happen , you just go into those place hoping for the best . i have never had anything great here . nacho platter too many re fried bean , to little nacho is ... .annnnnd i am out ! so what did we learn here ? good venue , stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand . the talent is really what you are there for so , enjoy the show !
i have been here twice now , and like the others you really only come to improve comedy club for the show . very reasonably priced for show though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.the food leaf little to be desired . we decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7 . having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken . spinach and artichoke dip wa good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chip . sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm ... . i think the chicken wa frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole wa artificial with a glop of cheese . it looked like a mess with big ole pile of fry . a lot of food for $ 10 . service ha always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18 % .
there is nothing like a saturday night filled with some good laugh , a few chuckle and a couple of good guffaw thrown in for good measure . that is exactly what we enjoyed on saturday night ! we hit the comedy club for an evening of tammy pescatelli - the hubby and i have enjoyed her routine on tv and on the occasional dve morning show.. she did not fail to give u a good evening of laugh ! the big surprise , wa gene collier - yep , of the post-gazette sport writer fame - a the opener . what a great opening act ! he cracked wise about the peril of being 58 and a baby boomer . we could relate ! the sightlines were lacking . there wa a rather large woman at the table in front of u with massive pittsburgh big hair . all night long my own head bobbed from side to side a i attempted to actually watch the show , and not just listen to it , a she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snack . with a 2 drink minimum , my first drink wa weak and the 2nd wa quite strong ! all in all , the two balanced each other out . but then , you do not go for the drink , do you ? an enjoyable evening !
tom green wa appearing here on jan 22 , 2012 . he wa hilarious . the improv is an excellent comedy club , in past show i have seen jim krenn , margaret cho , billy elmer , and so many more i forget . much like live from the improv on tv , the brick back drop make it feel like the nyc improv . hint : eat elsewhere , the food is not so great , have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant , most comedian head over to the rock bottom after to imbibe . dave attell is a regular at both place . two drink minimum , drink them slow and go elsewhere after the show .
decent , clean ( a far a i could sense in the dim ) ... about on par for what you 'd expect for a higher-end comedy club . that includes the $ 10/drink , two-drink minimum , automatic 18 % gratuity , and the comic spouting out the obligatory , `` do not forget to tip your waitress . `` trying to judge the place on it own merit and not on the entertainment value of the comic . ( if the latter , since we were here for frank caliendo , i 'd have given the place the full 5 star if only for him alone ! ) total cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from what could have been a 4-star experience for u . $ 80 for ticket online included $ 10 `` service fee '' and tax ( we had to : this wa a sold out show ) . add $ 25 for drink , gratuity , and more tax . we are talking 3-digits of $ $ $ for le than 2 hour of entertainment squeezed in between other patron and glass-wielding server while you sit on rickety chair . that is what a headliner act will cost ya ! will you see u here again ? probably ... but cost make it unlikely to be a weekly thing for u .
you know that place where you have never gone , then you go , then you are going all the time ? well the improv for me is one of these places.i am thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedian . most recently i saw hannibal burris , tommy johnigan and doug benson . all three performance were a hooting good time . on saturday afternoon at 2:20pm i went to see doug benson i wa accompanied by my boyfriend . you may know doug benson from the hit documentary `` super high me . `` ok so : pro wonderfully talented comedian clean bathroom pretty wait staff ha coors light on tap ( 5.75 per draft ) every seat in the house is a good seat con : expensive drinksexpensive food flavorless food dirty silverware far from my house mayo with french fry any way , i have enjoyed all my visit to the waterfront . i can certainly see myself seeing more show at the improve . the club is well maintained and the wait staff is friendly . bring a lot of money with you , you are going to need it . i do not know if it is true everywhere but at this improve there is are 2 item person , minimum order requirement . they served u warm mayo with our fry , what is this holland ! ! ! that sh*t wa gross . it wa both gross and also unusual.anyhow to catch a comedy show at the improve is a pleasure .
the place doe what it doe best - comedy . the food , however . blah.first off , if you go to a show , please note there is a two item per person minimum . this mean that from their extensive menu of overpriced bar food and drink , you are required to choose two item each . second , the soda are not free refill ! i learned that one the hard way . get water . third , before tipping your server , please make sure she ha not already taken her cut out . even after paying for two very bland , overpriced meal and way too many diet coke , i thought that my bill wa rather high . upon further inspection , i noticed that my server had taken an 18 % gratuity . the menu explicitly say that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for party of six or more , but there wa only two of u and we were not even drunk . i found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18 % even though i typically tip well over 20 % . overall , i do not like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show . i can see why they do it , but if i were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time i went to the movie , i would be far le inclined to go a i am not inclined to go to the improv again .
the pittsburgh improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the detail of mediocre execution ( some specific example at the end ) .the setup is nice , a delightful -- if a bit sterile -- reproduction of what you 'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough tv . the interior is clean ; the seat are comfortable ; and it is an ok atmosphere to see a show and laugh.it is too small , however , to attract many of the best act , which limit it ability to ever become the central hub for pittsburgh comedy . most of the big name that have recently come through pittsburgh -- jim gaffigan , louis ck , second city -- all perform elsewhere ( though they managed to get bob saget , to their credit ) .but the biggest problem is the food and drink . they are very up front about their mandatory two item minimum , but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several time during the show . the price are well above what i 'd consider reasonable given the quality , and i 'd begrudgingly -- or even happily -- just shrug off the cost the same way i would a stadium concession stand markup ... but the food is bad . you are forced to either ( a ) buy extremely overpriced drink ( 3.50 for a soda , for example , with no refill -- or ten dollar for one with refill ) , or ( b ) buy moderately overpriced food which you would not want in the first place . i thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable , until a few bite in i decided i 'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.still , i think this place ha a lot of potential ; the core idea is very workable ; and they do attract some really good comedian . two star for now , with high hope for improvements.a few specific drawback which could be very easily fixed:1 - a lot of the drink did not have price on them . i know this is not uncommon , but at a venue where every question you ask interrupt not only your own show-viewing experience a well a the experience of your neighbor , it is an incredibly poor decision here . make everything on the menu exceptionally clear . it is not that hard.2 - put the drink price on the website too . an improv representative ha personally responded to many of these yelp review , and she once said `` our menu and pricing are listed on our website , which make for easy planning ! '' i am calling shenanigan . not all the price are on the website , which make for difficult planning.3 - reminding me to tip my server during the show and adding an automatic gratuity to the check make me feel like you are trying to trick me . it is kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one is customers.4 - since the $ 3.50 soft drink do not come with free refill , the server should not ask `` would you like a refill on that ? '' or anything of the sort . they should ask `` would you like another one ? '' instead . they should also respond to request for refill by saying `` we do not offer refill , but i 'd be happy to get you another one . '' just because there is a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doe not mean people all figure it out . most patron do not even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere ( like a cola or diet cola ) , and the reading difficulty imposed by the darkness make them even le likely to browse the offering .
i love the improv . i think it a great way to start or spend a night ! nothing like a laughter filled night . i think it great that we get so many great comedian coming our way ( owen benjamin , pablo francisco super funny tammy pescatelli not so much . ) thing you should be aware of : the staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drink . i kinda wish their menu wa a little bit more extensive . their service is spottythe wait staff is a little iffy . i have been here many time and sometimes i get an attentive waitress and sometimes not . most recently our waitress wa rude , did not bother with pleasantry and barely took notice of u . also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity . if our waitress wa nice i would be more than glad to add to it but this time i wa like no way ! p.s . when i used my groupon i did not have any trouble
my husband and i went to do something fun . the comedy wa great ! the food , however , is mediocre at best . in addition , we were seated in the last row , and 10 minute into the headliner they sat someone else at our table , so that they were in front of u . i could not see a thing . when we received our check , they had added an 18 % gratuity without permission or notification . i will not be returning anytime soon .
who doe not love to laugh ? the improv is a great place to go for a good show a few time a year . the venue is clean . the comedian are good , for the price , and many time you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price ( i.e.tommy johnagin ) . however , be advised , if you attend more than one show every couple of month , you will see some of the same opening act repeated . this is my biggest gripe with the improv . i have been to the improv about 3 time over the past 4 month and have seen the same opening act a few time . i think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedian . are there not more talented comedian in pittsburgh ? a noted in other review , another area of improvement is the drink and food . i always attend the late showing so that i can eat elsewhere . the food is mediocre bar food at best . nothing more need to be said about that . i definitely do not mind the two drink minimum . i have been known to consume more than two drink in one setting but , the drink are insanely overpriced . $ 5 for a miller lite , $ 4 for a snapple , $ 10 for a fountain drink with refill . you are better off having your two drink during the show and going over the sing sing after for a draft . . or four . in addition , since they started offering a large groupon discount , the improv ha been packed . be aware that if you only have two people in your party , they may seat stranger at your table who are 6 foot tall and block your view .
we came to the improv for the first time on friday night for my wife is work holiday party . we arrived early for dinner and drink from a predetermined menu . dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged , almost brown iceberg lettuce , with some crouton and frozen-then-thawed looking tomato that were pinkish at best . i took a few bite of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad , and i can tell you it wa downright tragic . dinner arrived and since there wa not any vegetarian option on this predetermined menu , we received a dish that wa supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted . it wa a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl . it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked . the pasta wa overcooked , and the tomato sauce wa just watered down puréed canned tomato . i saw trace of onion in my dish but did not taste them at all . i wa so hungry that i salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bite . yuck . i did not make a dent in this crapfest . for dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake , which my wife ordered , and cheesecake , which i ordered . the chocolate cake had freezer burn . inexcusable ! it wa not edible . the cheesecake wa only a hair better , but it had obviously come out of the freezer a well . i know people are not coming here for the food , but if you are forcing them to order thing off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirement ( two drink/two menu item minimum ) then at least make some halfway decent food . it doe not even have to be memorable ... just not offensive . which it wa ! ! had i paid for any of this i would have made a huge stink , but i tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk . the comedian were good . the venue wa nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our `` event '' . not always the best thing in a comedy club ( we only got picked on a little bit ) . but damn , i wa hungry ! i found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy waterfront restaurant and how i 'd rather be there ... how i 'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner ... how i 'd rather have a giant bowl of captain crunch ... how i 'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria ... what a dreadful dining experience.my car wa also violated in the parking lot . i had an adorable german license plate on the front of my adorable german car which wa stolen while i wa eating hideous food , which wa just the slap in the face i wanted when finally retreating to my car . i feel sick in so many different way about this experience a a whole.the improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company . i truly believe that is the only thing that can save this place . do yourself a favor and eat beforehand , and just order a beer . well , two i guess . other diner at our table complained about the quality of the cocktail so i 'd steer clear of those . unless there is a can not miss type of comedian here , i can not ever picture going back to the improv . i 'd give the comedian 4 star , and the food zero star .
spent new year eve at the comedy club to bring the new year.i am new but it wa a good time . we had unlimited champagne , fruit and cheese . the comedy wa good.the service wa great.the atmposhere wa okay but it wa a comedy clud : - ) . you should check it out - comedy club bring a little spice to the city : - ) enjoy !
this wa my second visit to the club and it wa still a blast . my girlfriend bought ticket for john witherspoon for my bachelorette . we were all looking forward to it and it wa hilarious ! he wa wonderful . the server were fantastic . they always came back to check in on u and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink . i suggest the pink cadillac for a drink a well a the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert . the only reason it is not 5 star is because they had u wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building . we were to see the 9pm showing so the door were to open at 8:45pm . they came out and explained that the show had run over and we would not be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm . it wa 28 degree outside . we finally were able to enter the building , order drink then the show finally started at 9:45pm . the host did offer a blanket apology which wa nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late .
i have been here twice in the last month . it is a pretty great time . my first visit , the service wa pretty poor and the food wa cold by the time it got to the table . we had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian wa not that good ( although that is no fault of the club ) . but when i went to the second show , the service wa much improved . the burger i ordered wa fantastic and warm . our waitress kept the drink coming without interrupting u while the comedian wa on stage . we were also able to sit in the front this time and it wa a great experience . i will be going back soon !
good ! i can not comment on the food or the bathroom , but from what experienced it wa great ! the drink were decent , and i believe you must order two item at minimum . the staff is quick , but they should have more people working on a saturday night . before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.the comic we saw were funny a well . will definitely go back !
i love that we have a great comedy club in pittsburgh with a great location at the waterfront . perfect for a date night and i recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand . i received an online coupon code for $ 5 ticket for john heffron . what a deal-def . check for deal before you pay full price for any show here . we went early to pick up the ticket at the ticket office . people were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it wa freezing out . i had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at rock bottom . once they opened the door ( 15 minute before show time ) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back . it is not huge inside so there are not really any bad seat . they usually have an mc for the night who start warming up the crowd . this guy wa funny and so wa the opening act before john heffron . my only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the price are outrageous . $ 9.50 for a mixed well drink and $ 7 for draft beer . the soda wa $ 3.50 ! yikes ! at least we did not pay full price for the ticket .
i wa so excited when my husband gave me ticket to go here to see funny man bill crawford , part of the dve morning show for those of you who never heard of him . that is funny because a i wa telling people about going it became clear there are a lot of people that have not ... oh well ... let me mention this wa my first time there.so i wa warned in advance of the possible long wait outside and the two item minimum . well to my pleasant surprise there wa no wait , walked right in , greeted , an usher showed u to our seat and we waited le than 5 minute to be asked for our order . this wa nice . i will say that the show started at 8pm , and we were there by 7:20 or so . there were already people seated so we were by no mean very early , and heck there were people with full course meal and table of 10 . the price of the mixed drink were not disclosed on the menu , leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month , but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head ipa for $ 6.00 . now that may seem rather expensive and it is , but doable so i indeed did it ... my husband got a domestic and it wa between 4-5 buck . we opted not to eat there , a we were going to rock bottom after ward and i will get to that review later ... so the show wa good . there were moment that i think the comedian may have went off track and were just bantering , but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable . there were a total of 4 comedian , the mc , and two opening act for crawford . i actually really enjoyed them . the one or two thing i did not like about the place . the bathroom are in the lobby . a this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated ... this was/is stupid . i wa actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance . the same also go for smoking . since we were so early i took a break and it wa again awkward reentering . maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this . a stamped hand ? a ticket stub ? not sure but i know i would have felt better unlike feeling like i wa sneaking into the place . i would definitely return to the improv . i just hope i always have a rather positive experience !
it is not often that my wife and i get to go out , but we had ticket to see the wonderful lisa landry and figured since we were going to the improv , we may a well eat there too . i should have gotten on here and read the review before making that decision . we had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv . we were handed a paper menu with 4 item on it when we walked in the door . there wa no other menu at the table and our waitress did not offer u one either . she wanted our order , but a we were looking around the place , we realized that most of those around u were eating item that not on the menu provided to u . when asked about another menu , our waitress told u if we give her our drink order , she will see what she can do . the table next to u handed over their menu so we had something to work with . our drink came , we finally put our order in ... and that wa the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minute . when she finally came back , all she wanted wa to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drink . after 30 minute i wa finally going to get a second beer ! `` what about our food ? `` , we asked . `` oh '' , wa her answer . now , according to the menu , dinner came with a side salad , a complimentary glass of champagne , and a chocolate mousse dessert . that is all good and fine . after a couple of minute , someone , not our waitress , finally brought out our meal . when we asked him about our salad , his reply wa `` do you want me to take your food back ? `` . really ? ! ? ! `` do you want me to take your food back ? '' after almost 45 minute at this point , we had received 1 round of drink and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food . no , i do not want you to take our food back ! halfway through eating our meal , which were by this time cold , our waitress finally came back with our second beer . she asked u how everything wa . we asked about our salad . she said she wa told we did not want them . really ? ! ? ! is this a joke ? is it somehow part of the comedy routine that wa going on ? sadly , no . the service did not get any better . the food wa lousy . thankfully the standup wa great . lisa , lisa and matt all put on a hilarious show . will i ever go back ? do not know . it took u an hour and a half to drive the 16 mile to get there , thanks to traffic . i do know that if we do it again , we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else . the two drink minimum work at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drink . in case you are interested , i am a chef who ha been in the service industry for more than 30 year and worked every position possible in restaurant and bar . so , yes , i do have a preconceived notion a to how service and food should be . even on valentine is day .
my husband and i love going to comedy show and have seen some pretty good act at the improv . ticket price are not bad either . i am very particular about where i sit , and the person who seat you is willing to let you sit where you choose , especially if it is on a thursday or sunday night , since those are not particularly busy nights.i did have one bad experience , which is why i am giving this review 3 star instead of 4 ( it only take one poor experience , people ! ) . my husband and i went to see one of our favorite comedian on a thursday night . there is a two-item minimum , so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show . well , we were mistaken . first of all , our waitress wa rude and slow . after sitting there for 5 or 6 minute without service she finally come over and asks what we want . we both order a drink and food , to which she tell u that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salad and dessert . i wa annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.at any rate , i order a caesar salad and a beer . it come out and it is iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese , tomato , and other veggie . in other word , a regular salad . i inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused . i suppose she did not understand the difference , which wa odd . overall , i felt that there wa no apology for the fact we could not eat , let alone everyone else in the place . salad or dessert are not the greatest choice when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show . i think the improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasion , even if it cost them money . afterwards , i emailed the improv with my concern . never . heard . back.that being said , i will most likely return to the improv ... .but not for the service . because it is a great place to see comedy show and is not that expensive . customer service is terrible .
i went here for the first time the other night and had a great time ! the comedian wa hilarious and it wa a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friend ! my only complaint wa that it wa a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket , but every person need to buy 2 item of food/drink and the drink are not cheap ( around $ 10-12 ) . however , i would definitely go back sometime !
wast there last friday . seat right in front if the stage . the show wa good . the headliner , while a bit long , wa good . fantastic service from our waitress . will definitely go back .
if the improv chain did not bring in such amazing comedian , this place would be totally screwed . i always have fun watching the comedian , but i can not help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.first you buy the ticket , but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge . the real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 item during the show , beer are $ 5 or $ 6 and the cheapest thing on the menu , i believe . cocktail are $ 11- $ 13 . i think glass of wine are around $ 8 . there is a pretty good selection of food option . the improv doe have a lot of great comedian who pas through ! even the opening act are generally great ! line up early if you want a great seat right in the front ! the point is , a night at the improv will be fun , but if you are not prepared for it , it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair .
great night out . i do not know if christopher titus set the ticket price or the club did , but at $ 25 a ticket , we will be going back often . great line up of top name act coming to town . extremely nice staff . highly recommend .
absolutely loved it at the improv ! i saw sheryl underwood and she wa fantastic . it wa my first time being at the improv . after year of saying that i wanted to go , it really did meet my expectation ! the ambiance is inviting , with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place . we were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating , though we were encouraged to fill the seat in the front by the stage first . the seating is layered in tier . each tier ha a long booth with table and chair for seating . it wa very comfortable , roomy and an interactive set up . the stage is close to the seating ( some table are right at the stage ) with little space between you and the comedian , which made it very interactive and fun . we arrived at the improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm , with door opening at 10:00 pm . we waited in line until the door opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm , so they were really behind schedule . the show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedian before the main act . the show wa over around 1:00 am . the only negative were that the staff wa not very friendly and immediately told me that i have to buy a minimum of two item off of the menu . ( $ 30/ticket is not enough ? ) i wa not hungry and did not want to drink , so this wa a bit frustrating , especially because it wa not disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else . the server did not hold u to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and i got away getting 3 drink for the night . the food menu looked great and the price seemed reasonable , though if you want water you are looking at $ 5 for fiji or sparkling . it wa $ 8 for a glass of wine . $ 11 for bottomless soda , complete with a take home improv glass . the other thing that i did not like wa that an employee take your ticket while you are waiting in line and mark your hand with a dry erase marker . after one bathroom trip , the mark wa gone , so i think they need a more effective way to mark you a an already paid customer since the employee take your proof of purchase . these negative did not affect my overall experience negatively and i would most certainly go back ! it is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter !
so ... we got here and seated by 635pm . order placed . drink served . now it is 752pm . one of my party ha still not received his chicken sandwich . i hadmy shrimp diablo . it wa a described . spicy and good ! ! ! but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable . we also sent an order of chicken finger back ... dryer than sand . and my fiancés chicken caesar salad chicken wa a dry a the chicken finger . barely edible , in fact , she did not eat more than 3 piece of it . upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better .
it is sad that this the only place locally to see national comedy act ( other than the big 'uns in the cultural district ) . i hate this place is m.o . the space itself is fine ... only a few blind spot , nice intimate venue . they bring decent act in , although they have a lot of repeat and need to bring in more new act . but the two item minimum just infuriates me . overpriced , shitty food and drink . we went to see lachlan patterson last night ( hilarious show , very nice guy , signed our cd and posed for photo with people ) . we dropped $ 40 on a chicken quesadilla , 6 hot wing , and 2 yuengling draft . the whole time i just sit there thinking about all the amazing place i could have eaten for $ 40 . burgatory is right down the street . hell , tgi friday is would have been better . i have been to other comedy place in other city and they often have minimum but everything is either a lot cheaper or a lot better quality . the improv is saving grace is that they often have free or very cheap ticket .
the food is why i give them three star . burger wa processed and 1/2 raw , loaded fry where some random cheese . comedy depends on who you see .
went to see bret ernst ( one of my fave comedian ) . ticket say seating begin at 9pm for the 9:30pm show . well , a line had formed outside because they had not opened the door . that is all well and good if it is summertime but it wa 4 degree . people stood out there upwards of 20 minute , freezing . they did not let people in because they claimed the room wa not ready . seating is first come , first served . whoever designed this place should be shot . there is no lobby to hold people before a show . the improv in cleveland is superb . that location ha a huge lobby and bar where you can mingle before the show and they have usher seat you . the pittsburgh improv is a disaster layout-wise . beverage service wa fine . it got really , really warm in the room and even the comedian wa sweating like a freak show . of course bret and bill crawford were a hilarious a ever but man , this improv , a a comedy venue , suck .
we have been to the improv comedy club twice now and both show were amazing ; even the opening act ! the only downfall is the two drink minimum , which i understand , but their price make it ridiculous . we stuck to beer because we knew it would not be watered down . our waitress wa horrible . we did not have an opportunity to order our second drink until the other waitress were bringing out check . if our waitress wa more attentive , the club could have made more money off of u . oh well . i would recommend eating at a restaurant before the show because the food menu is limited and overpriced . the only other thing i am not a fan of is the seating . we were fortunate enough to get there early and have the back of a booth . the last few people who arrived got the turned around seat in front of u . i feel that the club should invest in long , thin table like bar have so everyone ha a surface to put their food or drink . overall , we love the comedian so we will definitely be back .
nice little venue for quality fun . i saw greg warren here last night and had a really good time . check out yippit.com or sign up for goldstar.com before buying ticket at full price . you can usually find substantial discount for show on one of those two site . sure there is a two drink minimum but i am thinking that it help pay for the comic and help keep the price of admission down . when you think about it , it is really a win-win .
roxy wa very funny . would definitely come back to see her !
positive : they regularly bring in national act . i have seen many of my favorite comic here . also , you get an opportunity to briefly meet the entertainer on your way out.negatives : drink price are high , and food quality in respect to the price is disproportional . entertainer-wise , there is a local comic who open up for many of the main attraction . i have seen him open up no le than four time over a span of 3 year , and his act is exactly the same every time . i have it almost memorized.continue doing the thing you do well , and try to improve the thing that almost everyone on yelp complains about , and you will be looking at 5 star from most . no one want to come to the improv to get `` straint up '' ( see what i did there , improv ? )
i love a good night of comedy . but recently i have gone to a couple and they were not all that funny one wa a special event too . i would recommend eating at another restaurant price seem to be a little over priced .
i went to the improv tonight with my husband and some friend and saw theo von . so funny . we had a great time . waitress wa friendly and very helpful without being intrusive during the show at all . pretty few option for food , and when you are with 2 people who do not drink and there is a 2-drink minimum , or 2-item minimum , the minimal food option are kind of a bummer . but it wa still a great time .
quality of the show and comedian = 5 star . i saw ian bagg and he tore down the house . just the opening 3 minute of his act had me dying . i wa involved in bringing all the big name comedy act to ohio state a a student and i have to say i wa really surprised at how good ian is improv wa . so there is no complaint here . quality of groupon is value = 1 star . so i still had to pay for ticket . yep at $ 20 for 2 people . not bad but the 2 item minimum is zero bang for your buck . the menu online is incorrect and the actual price are even higher than a $ 8 slice of frozen cake and $ 11 for a plate of 8 chicken nugget . holy moly , it is like cheap pub food at high end bistro price . then you have to tip on top of that $ 50 bill ( plus the $ 20 for ticket ! ) for two people and a crappy meal ? wow . i get that the place is trying to gouge money out of you for a good show . well ... try this -- charge $ 25 per person for the ticket and have the menu be optional . this way , you can guarantee high ticket sale but also get the people who will drink and eat there regardless . portion are reasonable , i suppose . i got the blt meal and chocolate chip cheesecake . left me very full but you best believe the only reason i ate there wa because i needed to hit that 2-item min . seating wa pretty cramped because you will have to sit with stranger . i went to the 7pm show which wa great because you can be seated early and just eat while you wait for the show to start . i saw this longass line when i left that i assumed to be the 9:30pm show with everyone waiting outside in the cold . seems like a crappy setup for the later show ! service wa haphazard . some of the waitress seemed pretty attentive and quick but mine wa particularly slow . he wa not rude but twice i had to ask the other waitress for sauce and a water refill . we got up to get napkin ourselves . i would wave to catch his attention and he would hurry off the opposite direction . ugh . please , groupon , there need to be reform on this pricing structure . come out with a new deal of paying full price for the ticket and then waiving the 2-item minimum !
went there for a comedy open mic competition . a friend of mine wa performing -- he wa excellent and won his competition . the club itself is pretty nice -- great layout and the staff were all nice . i did not drink so can not comment on the quality of food or drink , but everything looked good and the wait staff seemed attentive enough . located in homestead in waterfront area . not a cool a if it were in the city , but still pretty good .
came here for a show last week with my family and had a good time . our opening act were not the best , but the headliner brought some good laugh from the crowd . when we arrived the man taking ticket wa very friendly and okay with the fact that 2 member of our party were not with u . we just told him what they looked like and he let u go through anyway . what happened inside next wa what i thought would lead to bad review . we were a party of 5 and they have mostly 4 person table and then long booth bench with cocktail table in front of them . our host tried to seat u at a 4 person table with a 5th chair on he end only to have a very rude waitress come up and say we could not do this . our host then said `` she is your waitress and youdo not want to make her mad already '' . they then tried to seat u in between party on the booth bench against the back wall which with large men in our party that wa not okay . we decided to move to an end table and try again with a 5th chair and the waitress in this area wa fine with it and extremely friendly . she saved the review ! the drink were fine , the wine list in not great but for comedy club drink it wa expected . kudos to our waitress for being accommodating and pleasant , just wish they were all .
went for the first time last night and despite some of the iffy review , we had a great time . all of the staff wa friendly , from the host at the front to the other staff and the wait staff wa attentive ( but we did not get food , so i can not speak for how quickly ordering and getting food would be ) . price for drink are a bit much , for 4 small draft our check came out to about $ 50 , but i did snag ticket on goldstar for $ 10 a piece so i feel like it probably balanced out and the 3 comedian were great so i will not complain . i will say the food did not really look all that great in comparison to the price , but i can not speak for how it taste . overall , it is a fun place , no issue , i 'd go again .
the waterfront at homestead is insane , and save me the trip of driving all the way to ross park mall . anyway , the giant eagle here is enormous , a you 'd imagine . it is still a standard giant eagle , aka the best grocery store ever .
this is the best giant eagle in the area and is the most like grocery store in bay area . here is why:1 . they sell beer ! 2 . huuuuuge produce selection3 . natural/organic food section : cereal , pasta , soup , etc and fancy chocolate bars4 . long isle of ethnic food includes mexican , indian , italian , asian and , of course , jewish5 . functioning bakery with fresh , appetizing bread and dessert ( i am still loyal to allegro hearth though ) the store is huge and i have not been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flower , balloon , home/seasonal section , dvd rental and a photo center a well a a drive-through pharmacy . it seems a this ge just might be the answer to my grocery store woe .
probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county , if not all of southwestern pa. it selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most giant eagle , and it ha more upscale item . i live an easy walk from the swissvale giant eagle , but i often drive to this location for the superior selection .
nice giant eagle , not a nice a their new market district , but you can look at this giant eagle and see how they came up with the market district idea and rolled with it . fresh made sushi , good cheese selection , awesome bakery .
wahhhhh ! ! ! ! they are remodeling this one and it is frustrating ! i swear i do not mind change . i really don't~ i should have seen this coming . there were telltale sign of this happening . first , they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct iggle video wa . that is a-ok with me , i did not use the pharmacy anyway . but then , then they moved the whole toiletry section over there . they put my spaghetti and `` ethnic food '' section ( by the way , i love that ethnic food includes spaghetti ) to where my tylenol wa . my kitty food is now where my spaghetti once wa . can you tell how exasperated i am getting ? ? did i mention i do not mind change ? but here is the thing , i really hate grocery shopping . it is kinda sorta my own fault because i must read every label to make sure i am not eating something with 25 gram of fat and 5000 calorie ( even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time . ) so going to this giant eagle frequently wa nice because i knew were everything wa . now i do not ... .wahhh ! ok , i will stop cry . i know i will eventually be back . i am sure ( ? ? ) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they are done . but i can not take it for right now . i will be forced to shop at the ghetto bird down in the southside until my former # 1 store is all shiny and new again .
i like this giant eagle.they have the organic section and they are currently ( feb 2011 ) in the process of remodeling too , which is both annoying ( now ) and exciting ( for the future ) .pros : always seems to be decent parking available ; they have those cute little double-tier cart ; organic section ; wine vending machine ( that is freaking awesome -- yay , pennsylvania ! ) ; lot of self-check-out lane ; con : sometimes the staff is a bit cranky ( but that can occur anywhere , i guess ) ;
a far a ge is go , this location is great . it ha basically everything you need and is well organized . you can find a lot of ethnic ingredient you can not get at other ge store . they also offer a wine kiosk , hot bar , salad bar , and bulk olive . i would venture to say this is better than the market district .
waterfront geagle is my primary market . now that they have expanded and reorganized , i rarely even have to set foot in target anymore . yippie ! there is a wine kiosk ( suck it pa liquor law ) , you can buy crazy expensive 6 pack , cheese market , bakery , salad and hot bar , butcher , florist , dry cleaner , international food , pharmacy , and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area . they usually have a sufficient number of lane open , and it doe not get nearly a crowded a market district . i do wish a bulk spice selection wa included a part of the expansion , but you can not always get what you want , i suppose .
you are getting an extra star for two solid reason . one is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again ( and a bit fancier ) . two , and thee most important part , this iggle ha the best quality and well made sushi out of any iggle is out there ! believe me , i have eaten many a rainbow roll from many different location around the burgh and nothing ha compared . dare i say , it is a close a you get to going to a good sushi restaurant . bold statement , right ? i just love me some sushi and want it often , quick and convenient and this serf all those purpose with upholding the quality . need a quick sushi fix ? this place is it !
this is easily one of the best giant eagle i have ever been to . huge . very nice selection . easily comparable to whole food . went to their cheese market , and wa pleasantly surprised with the selection . i got beemster vlaskas , an amazing gouda . very large parking lot .
this place ha amazing selection when it come to some thing and zero selection when it come to others . we popped in here a couple time over the weekend i spent in pit and both time they did not really have what we were looking for . visit # 1 : liquid smoke . visit # 2 : hawaiian roll . i know these item must exist in pa just not @ g-eagle . they did however have crazy selection when it came to thing like ... .corned beef brisket or anything that ha potato in it . my californian mind wa boggled by the variety of brand and cut of corned beef that were available . too bad that wa not what i wa there for .
oddly enough , of all the giant eagle i have visited in pittsburgh , this is the only location that carry the toothpaste that i have used for most of my life ( outside of pittsburgh ) . the location is clean and the staff are friendly . i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment , a many of the item that i buy there are severely overpriced . but whenever i run out of grocery and toothpaste at the same time , i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here , although they may not carry all the grocery that i 'd like .
this is a absolutely beautiful giant eagle . i only stopped in to grab a quick bite from the prepared food section , but i wa rather impressed by how clean it wa . it wa 9 oclock at night , and they still had a huge section of prepared food available . the starbucks inside wa closed , probably due to the fact it wa a sunday night , but that is another plus !
in the market for unsalted cashew ? how about oyster sauce ? ahhh , here is an easy one : bean sprout ? well if you are , keep a crystal ball and rabbit is foot handy if you are planning on shopping at this giant eagle because you will need both a soothsaying ability a well a a fair share of luck on your quest at this dive . for a store of this size , they are frequently out of stock on item a common a jalapeño pepper to specialty food item like flat rice noodle . maybe i am the only person in homestead buying these item ... wait that doe not make sense , they 'd be in stock if i were ! do yourself a favor and either go to the greenfield , regent square or kennywood giant eagle . all three store are much smaller but seem to stock rare item like unsalted ( or a of late sea salted ) xochitl tortilla chip and honey nut cheerio .
i am with rachel c. on this one . you get an extra star for being a pretty giant eagle and a cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottle . even though the giant eagle in robinson is better in my opinion you , waterfront giant eagle , are not bad and pretty close to where i live .
i drive near this giant eagle on my daily commute , so i shop at this location approximately once/week . the location is pretty , and the beer selection is descent . they carry my favorite lambic , so i really can not complain ! they also have a very nice health and beauty section . overall , they usually have the product that i need.my only complaint would be wait time to check out . they never have enough cashier at peak hour . the store ha like 20 checkout lane , but generally only 5-8 open at a time . i always dread checking out , and whenever i see that checkout line look relatively clear , i hurry around the store and quickly gather the product that i plan to buy .
i found everything i needed and i liked the expansion , the antipasta bar is on point and they sale vanilla coke which made my hubby very happy . great store .
let me preface this by saying , i generally compare all grocery store to publix , maybe even kroger . that being said , the one thing giant eagle ( ge ) ha going for it is the quality and selection of item . there is no question that it ha everything you could want . that is where the praise end . let is just do this numerically ... 1 . price are outrageous . if you walk 100 yard over to the target next to it , you will find some of the same item for 30-40 % cheaper . a bag of gevalia coffee is $ 7.99 at ge , the same coffee at target is $ 4.99 . and it is not just coffee , and not just target . giant eagle ha little other grocer competition in pittsburgh . this being the case , if you are not near an aldi is , target or walmart , you have to go to ge for stuff . they are banking on this lack of competition . 2 . parking lot are thrashed every day , all the time . now , maybe you do not care . but when i go in the morning , they have been open maybe 30 minute and there are shopping cart littering the parking lot and the sidewalk in front of the building . they clearly do not bring them in at the end of the night . they also rarely have any small basket near the door , you will need to hunt for one . it is just laziness and a lack of care , on both account . they do not care about the appearance of the outside , nor the convenience for the customer . 3 . i do not normally mind the self-checkout , but only if i have a limited number of item . if i need a full grocery order , i am going to have to wait in line for one of the two cashier working the register , on a saturday . the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious . i am already paying exorbitant price , but i also have to ring up and bag my cart full of grocery too ? walmart doe not even make you do that ! so that is about it . if you do not mind paying much higher than average grocery price , ringing and bagging your cart full of grocery and generally being an afterthought a a customer , than giant eagle in waterfront is awesome !
this review is specifically for the dfs cleaner at this giant eagle location . i dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once ( i really should have known better ) . never again . my item came back completely covered in lint . i could let this slide , however my pencil skirt wa safety pinned to the hanger . the weight of the skirt caused even larger hole than what were placed there by the pin . being that it is a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in , there is no way that i can wear it again . this wa an expensive skirt , completely ruined . very disappointed . again , this review is just for the dry cleaner . the rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other ge is i have been to in pittsburgh . just do not take your dry cleaning here .
i have stopped by here a few time ( most recently tonight ) to pick up random grocery . this store is located next to one of the bike trail that i frequent , hence it convenience despite being fairly far from my apt.on the positive side , i appreciate the size of this store and the selection of product . in term of size , it is larger than the shadyside market district ( my normal grocery store , hence my standard of comparison ) , and i 'd say the product selection is very similar . unlike the md , when i have visited , the aisle have seemed fairly empty of customer , which may be due to the time of my visit ( usually between 7-8pm ) , a well a the size of the store . because it is not a market district , the price are a bit le expensive , which is nice.on the negative side , the checkout always seems to take forever due to slow customer and/or employee , despite that i have only purchased a couple of item at a time . the `` express '' lane move at the speed of molasses , and the self-checkouts are even worse . speaking of which , this store ha *way* too many self-checkout lane ( about a third of the lane ) , and the non-express one with the belt are unintuitive.prior to tonight , i would have awarded this store a rating of 4 or perhaps even 4.5 . however , checkout tonight wa even more of a pita than it usually is . none of the normal express checkout lane were staffed with cashier , despite that i saw at least one employee loafing around talking to another . so , i wa forced to use one of the many self-checkout lane . normally , i do not mind this , esp . when i am only purchasing a couple of item , but the empty self-checkout lane that i spotted wa one with a conveyor belt , and i could not figure out how to use it ( not that it mattered , since i had only one item , but the self-checkout lane must be operated using a very specific procedure -- see below ) . so , i moved over to one of the express self checkout lane ( similar to those in the shadyside md ) , which i knew how to operate . however , i still managed to bungle the process since i forgot to scan my one item *before* i put it on the scale that double a a bagging station , so i had to wait for one of the ever-so-slow employee to come over and key in an authorization code so i could pay.i am not sure if the self-checkout stand that ge us are standard in the industry , since i have never used them anywhere else , but i *hate* the whole weighing/bagging process . in order to use the self-checkout station , each item must be scanned and then placed on the scale , and if the weight is not correct for any reason ( including using your own bag ) , an employee is summoned to check it . i assume the intention is to prevent people from shoplifting , but ( 1 ) it is a major pita for both customer and employee ; ( 2 ) most of the employee ( including the one i dealt with tonight ) do not care , and just key the code without even looking at the error message explaining why they were summoned ; and ( 3 ) i doubt most shoplifter pay for any of the item they are pilfering -- they most likely just stuff them into their purse , clothes , etc . and walk out ! /rant3.5 star .
just about every you need.with great hour , a solid hot bar , sushi ( if you are into that ) , a dry cleaning service , pharmacy , ton of produce , bakery and butcher counter you can not go wrong . two thing that drive me crazy always needing to use my perk card for self check out and the lack of hand cart in the front . i always have to walk to a lane and hunt for a basket then double back , super annoying . that said it a small , and easily repairable ( hint ) issue that should not keep you from visiting .
i do not know why , but i just can not like this location very much . i lived in the area for a little over three year and would always go to another ge before this one . maybe it is the way it is set up or maybe it is the way that the lighting seems so very dim.the selection is typical for any ge , broad and expansive . some price are a bit steep . this location , like many others , ha expanded their pharmacy/health care area . which is nice , it save an extra trip to a drug store .
one of the best grocery store in the area . good produce , wide variety of cheese , good cut of meat and there is even a six pack shop on the premise .
year ago i would have given the big bird 2 star . what changed my mind ? competitive pricing . thanks , ge for making it worthwhile to shop your sale . while your no aldi , you definitely are winning on this front . this is my goto ge . always clean , organized and great selection . added beer a couple year ago and the deli , prepared food are up to par a well . always busy and parking never an issue .
this is a review of the pharmacy . after having them screw up a third time i felt that others should know that this is a pharmacy to avoid . the first time they misread a prescription and gave me the wrong dose of synthroid , about 1/10th of what i needed . i ended up so sick after 2 week of taking too little that i wa half dead before the problem wa caught . their response when i told them wa to say `` oops '' and `` it will not happen again '' . not even a sorry , and it never did happen again b/c i went to costco after that . this latest time wa classic . i came with a simple scrip . costco wa closed so i went to giant eagle . after 45 minute the finally inform me that they can not fill it b/c the scrip is not specific enough ( it wa for a common antibiotic , nothing complicated ) . they did not bother to call me earlier or tell me sooner , just made me wait and wait and wait until i pitched a fit to tell me that they could not fill it . it wa late and i went to rite aid in sq . hill with the same exact scrip and they had zero issue filling it quickly . wtf ? how can it be easy peasy at rite aid but giant eagle can not even muster the effort to tell me that they are too incompetent to fill it out ? i wonder if there is even a legit pharmacist working there at all . it seems like they are not even staffing the pharmacy with trained tech , just random people off of the street . do not waste your time , or risk your health . go to any other pharmacy in town , avoid giant eagle .
i luv store , plenty of cashier . my father eats there couple time a week . he is a senior citizen and he usually get free coffee because he is a veteran . last week he wa told they no longer doing that program . today he went to the edgewood giant eagle and they gave him free coffee .
this giant eagle is one of the only thing i miss about old house . the produce section and deli were great . also had an overall nice selection of everything .
this is a great supermarket ! all of the staple . great deli , market square and bakery . fresh produce and extra convenient to have vegetable and fruit cut and packaged . love the fact that i can shop , drop dry cleaning , and pick up pharmacy item in one stop . close to other shopping and wonderful restaurant .
i personally like this giant eagle . i dont think i have given any ge 4 star , so thats saying something . i should start by saying that i live in southside , so most ge is are equal or worse than that location . the waterworks location is decent in my book . they sell beer , they have a cute little cafe sitting area , they sell `` meal for 2 '' in their prepared food section , produce always seems great , cashier are friendly ect . the location seems pretty large . i also like how there are 2 entrance ( one at pharmacy . ) the parking lot is pretty large so it help having another entrance for cold or rainy day . i am at this location alot more than the southside ge since my gym is in the waterfront . it make it easier to get everything done in one plaza.i can not hate on this ge . it seems similar to a market district but i dont believe that it is ... ... yet .
one comfy seat in the entire place , but they have a cafe , they have good book to look at , and they are open until 11pm . what more could you want ? why an apple purse of course ! and a nice earl gray tea thrown in for good measure . wow ... i love this place . i am such a nerd ... only a nerd would enjoy going to a book store and reading a much a i do . the extra amenity just make it that much more enjoyable .
like any barnes & noble , it ha a nice comfy cafe , and a large selection of book . the staff is very friendly and helpful . they stock a decent selection , and the price are pretty reasonable . obviously it is hard for them to compete with amazon . however since all the small shop bookstore are gone , it is nice to walk into one every once in a while .
i still can not believe that pittsburgh ha no independent bookstore ! a a result of this i have ended up spending a fair bit of time at this barnes and noble location . a with all barnes and noble store it ha a cafe and a decent selection of popular title . i am a bit surprised at how smallish it is compared to other store in this chain . the bargain section seems to be perpetually picked through . the selection is ok in that it is well stocked but sometimes a bit disorganized from other customer pawing through the book , le popular title are a bit hard to find . the customer service here is pretty good.they could use more chair .
great barnes and noble location , and they have plenty of book that will help you pas the time .
barnes & noble , it is like the wal-mart of bookstore . beating down the competition of other now defunct national competitor and mom and pop type store alike . i am not quite sure whether i am in a cafe , at a newspaper stand , a book store , a cd shop , a movie house or a flea market sometimes . with all the table and shelf that you have to dodge it is a bit hard to figure it out . feel like the place should implode on itself and then reform into an audio book about coffee.i do not know about y'all , but i 'd rather buy my book from a place that ha more knowledge about the merchandise they are selling than a national chain like this .
such nice staff . i really lament the decline of the modern bookstore . i really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book . the store ha a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind . i really hope this store stay here for some . the price are also fair and often have great discount .
i find this location , clean and well organized , but that is not the reason it is getting 5 star ! i called today to look into whether or not their may issue of magazine were out ( i need them for my job ) and erin so kindly went checked on every single magazine i asked about ! now that is customer service ! well done , well done !
i have to agree with matthew u on this one . i do enjoy barnes & noble but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar . i went here after a dinner date with some neighbor and could not believe how packed it wa . we had to wait 10 minute just to find enough chair to seat 4 people . we ended up stealing them from other table . not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minute just to get an ice tea lemonade.so amidst all the book , newspaper and magazine they have an audio and video section . the price are not anything to rave about . i can buy the same movie online for a lot cheaper there is just the waiting period . i do shop here sometimes for there discount book . i found a lot of great recipe and mystery book for really cheap , like under $ 5 . that is a pretty good deal but considering there is a half priced book store who ha a great selection of book for literally half the price of retailer , how can you beat those price . b & n is more of a hangout spot with book in case you want to buy one right there and then . but everything is kind of confusing you always need to ask where something is . i 'd rather shop online for anything i really want . it is just not worth it to buy it wholesale .
this bookstore is absolutely packed full of stuff ! they have lot of book , a display of nook , dvd and cd , miscellaneous item like notebook and calendar , and a cafe . though a large assortment is nice , i feel like the space is very cramped . i have purchased a couple book from here - which were pretty easy to find - and have purchased food item from the cafe . the cafe is not very impressive . i have been pretty underwhelmed by all the food item that i have purchased here . i got a slice of quiche here last night when i only had 10 minute before a hair appointment at ulta across the street . not only did they take 5 minute to microwave it , but it also came out smelling burnt and burning hot . a little band wa singing and playing a variety of instrument while i wa here . i wa not very impressed until i realized that they were high school kid . i thought it a really nice that barnes & noble would let them perform in the store ... and a great way for b & n to get a lot of their family member in the store , too .
are b & n not allowed to have lounge area anymore ? i used to love studying and doing work in their comfy chair and sit there allllll day ... but i feel like within the last 4 year or so , i have not been in a single b & n that had such area anymore . i love book and have always felt that b & n can give you a good deal . but i am not a fan of this particular location because it is not that big . although , it is pretty clean ! the starbucks area they have is okay . the starbucks employee in these type of location are always not the best..but i do not go there for the coffee obviously . i do find it annoying that they do not take starbucks giftcards though - i believe they take b & n giftcards and you can also apply your b & n membership discount.also , their bathroom are pretty atrocious . if you can hold it , i would advise you to hold it.parking : the location is within a shopping area..so i would not say it ha it is own private lot per se , but it is an open lot and not actual 'street parking .

i love book . i love to look at them , hold them , read the cover , thumb through the page , and then finally i love to dig into a juicy story . when i am in the area i love coming in here for a latte and book browsing/reading . most of the time i cave and buy a book.this store is clean and their employee are helpful and kind . they have two entrances/exits available , a fairly large section for movie & music , study guide , and other organized section like self-help and history . i personally love the variety of cook book there . one of the attractive point of this store is a cafe . i can come in , sit down , read a magazine or book and just chill . the downside is the chair are not super comfortable ( to me ) and the cafe is usually packed with people . i wish they had more seating option around the store.it is a convenient location to come in and kill some time like others have mentioned . there is a lot to find in there so come back and browse !
there is nothing like a book and no better place to find one than a book store . this barnes and noble carry on a long history of excellence . they always have an extensive selection and a friendly staff that is willing to find what ever book you are seeking .
it seems every time we go to waterfront we end up coming here every time . i like the store but it seems rather daunting in that it is so huge . pretty much every time we come here if we have not already hit up the starbucks in the middle of the walkable part of the waterfront where many of the retail store are we will go to this one which is not that far away.there is much more seating at this starbucks than the one in the middle a well a it just feel le cramped . the store ha not changed much , most of the special and clearance stuff is at the front while the alternative entrance at the back is where all the music and movie are . the store is pretty organized though by type whether it is child is , fiction , magazine , game and toy etc there is pretty much something for everybody . the nook section is pretty much right when you walk in through the main entrance . i do like this store however i wonder how long it will exist with everything like amazon and e-readers changing how people get their material these day .
went to barnes and noble waterfront with 3 book on my list . first one there were several book by the same name so they wanted the name of the author . went to look it up on my phone ... ..barnes and noble wifi had blocked me . wanted me to sign it and allow them access to my information ... .not . long story short they only had one of the 3 book i wa looking for and it wa $ 4 le on amazon ... .lost this customer .
their food is amazing . they have a deal that you can get a soup and salad for 6.95 ! also they have drink from starbucks and desert from the cheesecake factory . what i am eating right now is the tomato caprese which is delicious and their soup which is homemade chicken noodle soup which is awesome and the tiramisu cup which i never had before . you should try it if you are in the waterfront in homestead .
i stopped in here yesterday looking for something specific ... i wanted to find a book with lateral thinking puzzle or some type of mini mystery . you know , the kind where there is a short story ( 2 or 3 page ) with some type of problem or 'who-done-it ' to solve at the end . my bestie and i go to the pool a lot in the summer and i thought it would be something fun to sit and read while we were lounging out . i used to read them all of the time when i wa younger and thought it would be something different . and yes , i know i could check online but , hey , i wa already here.any-who ... .i go in and easily find the `` customer service '' area , which is located in the middle of the store . it is a round kiosk . one woman is being waited on by an employee . there are 5 other employee standing behind the kiosk , talking among themselves . one of the worker notice me and come over to help . i tell him what i am searching for and he quickly look it up on the computer . he take me to an area of puzzle , but they are crossword , sudoku , coloring book , etc . i tell him these are not what i am looking for . he said he might have something where the magazine are . he go off to check while i look around . he come back with some magazine , but it still is not what i am interested in . ( sorry c dub ) . i thank him and continue to browse on my own . pro : the place is clean and well organized . area are pretty well marked by genre , discount book , card , etc . the guy who assisted me wa friendly and tried to be a helpful a possible . con : they did not have what i wa looking for . also , it wa not very appropriate to see a bunch of staff standing around the middle of the store while there are a lot of customer around .
one of my favorite place to go in pittsburgh with friend . good place to chill , eat , drink and watch the game , and maybe some pool afterwards . the food is not bad , they have pretty good deal for those who are on a budget . `` dollar burger night '' where you build your own burger is fun , but the patty can be dry sometimes , so remember to get them sauced . iceberg wedge salad is a good salad to have , the wing arent a good a you would like , i had tried the spicy killer one and didnt even have to drink water . but overall it a nice place to go because it is cleaner than most bar you will go and it serf better food than other place a well .
nice venue , good food , great beer , awful service . staying at the sheraton here i have patronized bar louie a dozen time recently and they screw up the order in some fashion every single time , without exception .
i stopped here yesterday with rob and matt after golf to have a few drink prior to seeing `` the hangover '' at loews across the street . incidentally , `` the hangover '' is one of the funniest movie i have seen in year and worth the $ 10 to see it in the theater . okay , back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice . there are plenty of hightops , plasma and a few booth . it is spacious and they have outdoor seating and open window . we sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who wa tending a pretty much empty bar . i ordered a guinness a usual , rob ordered a long island iced tea and matt had a miller light . make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you will be getting the stuff in the plastic bottle . i sampled rob is long island tea and it wa not that good way too much sour . the next one he ordered wa much better after a little guidance to the bartender . the bartender herself wa okay , not too friendly but quick enough with the pours . i do not remember her name which is usually not a good sign . we ordered a few thing from the appetizer menu . we started with the chip and salsa . the chip were crisp enough , but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the color were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup . rob then ordered the philly cheese steak slider . i tried one it wa okay i guess the bun wa warm and it wa pretty loaded with cheese and onion . he asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out , which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple block away . this pretty much sum up my experience at the bar louie is i have been too . they kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service . maybe i am being too critical ... i tried to order the baked goat cheese , but they were out ... so , i settled on the hummus appetizer . this wa surprisingly pretty good . the pita wa warm and toasted the hummus had lot of flavor and the tabouleh wa edible . it is probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here . matt had the hot wing which i tried one and it wa okay , your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing . all in all this place is not that bad . if you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you are more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse .
fantastic food . this place is mainly a `` bar '' and doe get crowded but i really like the pizza here . in fact i have never had a bad meal . the staff are ussually very helpful but it doe get a bit loud inside when crowded .
do not even think about not getting the pretzel dipper it pretzel stick with honey mustard , cinnamon butter , and a spicy queso dip . the queso is my favorite but they were all delish . i also got the bruschetta which wa very garlicky but delicious . 5-7 m-f is 1/2 off appetizer so i wa able to get both the pretzel stick and bruschetta for 7 buck a a meal . the menu had a pretty wide range- my friend very much enjoyed a pear and chicken salad . we did not get drink but some looked good ...
an absolute must if you are going to a movie and want a drink ( $ 3 draft and $ 5 special martini ) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7 . however , we were bothered that none of the special martini actually resembled a real martini . no gin or vermouth wa used , it is mostly puree and champagne float with flavored vodkas.anyway , the small plate made for good `` upscale '' bar food . half-price apps make for a cheap , but nice , dinner and a movie - great , great special . however , i would not buy a full-priced dinner here . nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price . the baked goat cheese wa small but delicious , and the tempura fried shrimp wa just right but the sauce did not match up exactly.be warned that the seat make you feel like you are going to be swallowed by them . seriously , the booth wa like sitting in the mouth of a whale .
the pro : great view of the city and river in good weather ... lovely for loud large groupsvaried menu with some original itemsgreat place to watch a game inside with a huge barfun locationgood place to take out of towners.the con : the food when i went yesterday wa not great . we got the wrong sandwich , our order wa not a described because the kitchen wa out of `` lot of thing '' ( tell u when we order , not when you deliver the meal without element on the plate . ) can be loud -- not a place for a romantic date ... the bathroom condition wa really bad.the server did comp up an appetizer , and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow . the view wa great , and we did enjoy walking around seeing the fountain dance to `` pour some sugar on me '' seriously ? ! ? ! ? yes ! classy eh ?
went there on saturday night following a movie at loews . we sat at the bar and watched the olympics on their multiple large flatscreen tv . ordered the calamari and shrimp quesadilla . the calamari wa crisp and plentiful the quesadilla however missed the mark . it wasnt crispy and it tasty sauscy instead of gooey . the menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicity represented . gordan ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight . miller lites are $ 4 a pop which wa a big downer a i got my $ 85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites . great atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pen game.food look like it hit or missall in all would rather drive down the road to the south side for a post movie food grub and tottie .
the word `` epic fail '' get thrown around a lot these day ... .but i really feel like they apply in this situation.we went on friday , april 2 and arrived at 5:10pm . it wa busy , but not crowded ... .no waiting for a table . half price apps and drink -- we ordered at 5:20.the food ( just appetizer , mind you ... ) did not arrive till almost 6pm . drink were ordered and were unbelievably slow . we placed one order for 6 draft beer at 6:15 ... they arrived at 6:52 . *37 minute for beer . *by 7:00 , we were canceling food order which we 'd given up on after waiting almost an hour . we just wanted to leave.instead of comping anything , they added 18 % gratuity to each of our bill . uhhhh yeah . thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back . we finally were able to leave around 7:30.bar louie : you are dead to me .
i had the exact same experience a john r. went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street . the place wa near empty and there were three waitress . got seated and waited on immediately . ordered drink , and it took them 15 minute to come ... no , not alcoholic drink , two water and an iced tea . this should have been a bad sign , but at this point we ordered food.20 minute go by ... we flag down our waitress , to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minute . she said our food would be out in a few minute . another 20 minute , still no food , and our waitress is nowhere to be seen . we flag down another waitress , she say she will find our waitress , who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitress . she finish her conversation and finally make her way over to our table about five minute later . she say she did not even realize our food had not arrived ( well , you never even checked on u , so of course you did not ) . after speaking with the kitchen staff , she informs u that she `` definitely '' put our order in so it `` must have been given to someone else by mistake . '' because they would not have noticed that that wa not what they ordered ? seriously ? the waitress told u she could give u our food for take out and , since we were starving , we reluctantly agreed . 10 minute later , our food and the bill arrived . all that wa comped wa the iced tea , and we got some free utensil and wetnaps . how generous ! we shovelled what we could into our mouth , did not leave a tip ( thankfully , we did not have the added gratuity that john had ) , and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food . worst part ? i opened the wetnap , and it wa totally dry . of course.however , i gave this place two star instead of one . that is because my food , when i finally got it , wa perfect . i had the greek burger and it wa huge , cooked exactly how i like it , with delicious topping . i really wish i could come back here for the food but ... hell no .
service ha always been good and the food consistent , we usually come for happy hour when apps are half off and there is some great deal on drink a well.things that stand out to me : veggie wrap , fried zucchini , hummus tabuleh and tzatziki platter , and house salad with ranch ( their ranch is so good i could eat it with a spoon )
let me just say that this used to be a place i loved.remember when you 'd go somewhere and have good food , great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few month you 'd go back and have it all again ? well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything ha changed in a way that you can not describe and the place is no longer familiar . to me , that is bar louiei can not say the food is bad . i had an order of the pretzel stick for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzel were stale . i will say i still ate them so shame on me . my sandwich ( the mario ) a always wa very good.now here come the bad:1 . there were fruit fly everywhere . i felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump . at one point i had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer . i understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit fly to hover over my table.2 . the place is enormous and they had one , very nice , but over worked server . the girl looked like she wa about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.3 . because of number two our service in general wa not good . i can not totally blame the girl she did the best we could . i mean . i have played diner dash on my ipad , i know what happens when a place fill up too quickly when you are the only one working.it is sad when a place you love turn into a place you never want to go again . i think i am being very generous by giving it two star but because i used to love it so much i can not rate it that low . part of me hope it get better , but like an absentee father it will just let me down again .
we were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm . the 2 of u got to bar louie at 8:30 . we sat outside , and it wa nearly 30 minute before the waiter even stopped to get our order . i tried stopping a waitress but wa told 'this is not my table ' . finally the waiter took our order . 1 sam adam light bottle , and one pineapple juice+vodka . after about 15minutes another waiter ( maybe the manager i do not know ) asked if we had been waited on . we said yes , and told him we had been waiting . he left , and another ( different ) waitress came to bring u our drinks.. they were wrong.. my date wa given vodka on the rock . and i wa given a sam adams.. they took these back , and another 10 minute before the correct order wa served.. we told them to bring another round and the check . it wa 20 minute before they returned.. and they forgot the check.by this time we had to go to be on time for the movie.. my date asked for the check again so we could leave.. finally they brought it and i gave him my card , when he came back we signed it and left in a hurry to catch the movie.for 2 bottle beer , and 2 pineapple juice + vodka i wa charged $ 31.03 . i did not have time to complain or ask . i will not be going back .
food wa ok. waitress wa a huge air head . waited 25 min for my $ 7.00 beer . only got it after i reminded her . it is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised a a local commodity .
although i would not travel out of my way to have dinner here , this is a resturant that i enjoy having a meal at , when i am in the homestead water front . on all of my visit here i have enjoyed the tempura shrimp . the dipping sauce are to die for . i have found myself craveing the tempura shrimp , and the accompanying sauce . the first time i ever had dinner here wa a a birthday dinner with me and my big sister . so this resturant ha sentimental value to me . i attach eating here to having a special night out in the waterfront . bar louie ha some very flavorful and fun dish for bar food , that is .
when the ratio to wait staff to diner is 3:1 you 'd think you could get service ! ! ! nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patron . i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first . i came here on saturday ay 6pm . almost none of the diner had food on their table and many of them did not have drink in the 15 minute i wa there i counted 9 waitress again i counted 9 waitress and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order . just from the look of it i could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck . so after 15 minute of waitress counting we left with empty belly .
i wa looking to get out of the apartment on a really nice , sunny day and we decided to drive to waterfront and walk around . all around great day until we hit bar louie for some drink and appetizers.i am giving it one star , though it deserves none , because our waitress wa nice , if a bit inattentive , and the hummus app we ordered wa pretty damn good . outside of that bar louie leaf a lot to be desired.this is probably the first place i have been to where they charge $ 10 and up for all mixed drink . to me , that is beyond ridiculous . bar louie is not an upscale restaurant , a much a they wish they were , and paying almost $ 60 for three drink and two appetizer is insanity defined . a i mentioned the waitress wa friendly , but she definitely did not come back and check on u enough . i really wanted to like this place because of thing i had heard and the drink we had were really damn good , but if it want to spend that kind of money , i will go somewhere that i can get good service .
i came here last night to get a few appetizer before a movie , and wa hoping to be able to write a review on the food . unfortunately , i can not because the service wa so bad that i left before i had the chance to order . we found seat at the bar behind the tap . after sitting there for 5 minute and not being acknowledged , we thought that they might not be able to see u , and so we moved to a different pair of seat in the middle of the bar , grabbing a few menu on the way so we would be ready to order . it wa fairly busy , but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drink - everyone wa seated and i am sure they face much busier time . we sat in our new seat for almost 15 minute ( i timed it - i am not exaggerating ) , and were not even acknowledged . you would at least think the bartender would acknowledge u and tell u he would be with u when he could , but despite staring him down almost the whole time , we could not even make eye contact . i hope this is a fluke but will probably not be back to find out .
went here for drink and nacho and it is a very nice establishment . the nacho were very good the drink pricy but t be expected in a setting like this place . there are fire place outside on the patio a huge bar and even though it doesnt seat many there is a very nice cozy setting upstairs . go here to relax or enjoy good food both thumb up .
the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt . and , in looking at other review , i am not the first . there are many option at the waterfront , and i would suggest you try any of them ; but stay far away from this place !
i have eaten just once , mostly i go for drink . nice , lively place , nice outdoor seating for the summer and fall.drinks are good , service is good.location is great a well , right across the movie theater .
love the ambiance and food ! !
$ 1 burger night on tuesday . add ons more .
haha only came here once for happy hour , but i am just pleased with the price . i guess coming from ny , anything would be better price wise . $ 3 for draft and a big selection of beer so good time . also it is right across the theater so it is a good place to go and chill before the movie starts.. which is exactly what i did haha .
it wa the first time that i went to this location . we sat outside and it wa a beautiful night . i had the bbq burger with fry . for the price of the burger i expected something much better . it wa a very thin burger when it came to the meat . a a whole it looked large but that wa only because of what they piled on top of it . in addition , their drink are expensive ! just one cocktail could run between $ 10- $ 12 and they are not very large . our waitress spent more time talking to her friend at the next table than actually tending to our need . there are enough restaurant at the waterfront that i do not know that i will come back here .
i personally enjoyed my recent visit to bar louie with a friend but completely understand the poor review on help . the restaurant is pricey for what it is , and our waitress wa a bit lackluster.so why doe bar louie get 3 star ? happy hour and a nice patio ! happy hour is on monday-friday from 4-7pm and offer lot of different option -- $ 3 draft , $ 4 wine , $ 5 martini , and 1/2 price select appetizer and flatbread . my friend and i ordered 4 martini and 3 appetizer between the 2 of u , and our bill wa le than $ 40 total . not bad ! i ordered a strawberry peach bellini and a s'mores martini , and both were tasty . we shared bruschetta pomodoro , spinach & artichoke dip , and roasted vegetable flatbread . the food wa also good , and i would order all three item again in the future.my recommendation is to understand what bar louie is good at ( happy hour ) and only frequent the restaurant at those time !
this is one of those place where the presentation is nice , but the taste is too ordinary . friend and i went here for happy hour ( starting at 5pm ) . they claimed to have $ 1 draft , $ 5 mixed drink , and half off appetizer . when we got there , we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain item , so pretty much the discount wa pointless . we ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizer . i only had appetizer here so i can not really judge them for their entrées , but i will rate according to my eating/drinking experience . i got the spinach artichoke dip . it wa a little runny and the dip to chip ratio wa disappointing . for a dip , it had way too many obstacle built in to it . i do not know what they did with the artichoke , but it wa super fibrous ... i felt like i wa chewing grass . overall , i would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain . food wa way too average for the high price .
i am surprised by the low review . i am a regular here . perhaps it is a little bit pricey , and that is the concern . but , it seems like everything is pricey these day . their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- hot , fresh pretzel with sauce . i also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap , with broccoli instead of fry , or their salad wedge . they have got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornament , but , well , it is outdoors.in the past , service wa really bad . i quit going for a while , after having to `` do the wave ' for a check . but , for the last 2-3 year , it ha been really good . i have found the staff to be professional , attentive , responsive , and friendly . maybe these are old review ?
this place wa pretty good food , but the service however wa just horrible . a a friend said they hire for look , not work ethic . plus the fact that it took forty minute just to get a couple appetizer wa ridiculous . our server seemed more interested in the table full of girl than actually waiting on u . the couple behind u came in the same time and wa not even attended too until after our appetizer were being cleared off . the food wa pretty good , but because of the service i will not be returning .
a far a chain restaurant go , bar louie is ok . i really like their appetizer and their salad , but i do not care for their burger or pasta . their drink are ok . they are normal corporate restaurant drink ... i.e. , applebees.service is hit or miss . last time i went , i had just fine service . the time before that wa also just fine . sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doe not know wtf he is talking about . ( once , i went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it wa red zinfandel . i had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is , in fact , pink . i still do not think he believed me . it would have been amusing if it were not for the fact that it wa actually annoying ) . thing i like : calamari , pretzel stick , wedge salad , some of the sandwich . thing i dislike : frozen burger they sell for $ 1.great to stop in right before a movie at loews , though ! : - )
server are chatting , not paying attention to table . i can see my salad is ready at the window . worst serf ever .
i must say , my experience last night at bar louie wa wonderful . i wa hesitant to go because of the other review here , but my husband convinced me to give it a try . the place is seat yourself and it is loud in there . i wa a little underwhelmed by that at first but i got used to it and found myself enjoying the energy.our service wa fantastic . courtney wa great - super attentive , brought our drink out in le than 5 minute , brought our food quickly , checked on u just enough ... and the place wa packed.the drink were perfect , just strong enough . we tried the peach lighting and the tiki drink . i liked the tiki thing better but that is just personal choice . there were real berry mixed into that one . yum.on to the food ... my turkey/ham/brie sandwich wa delicious and my husband loved his burger . the highlight of the meal though wa the whiskey cake . sonnet-worthy.we will definitely go back again .
one of my favorite place , and they have thee best lemon drop martini is ... plus the bar tender look like clark kent ( superman ) very handsome guy
meh , i just do not see the appeal bar louis ha to pittsburghers . i guess this particular restaurant benefit from people who work at the waterfront stopping in after a shift . it is always packed . being so close to the amc theater , they get traffic before and after movie . it is expensive , the food is so so . before i get ahead of myself , i had the bbq ranch chicken salad without chicken . the bbq ranch dressing wa very good , but it is very easy to duplicate at home . it is equal part ranch dressing and kc masterpiece hickory bbq sauce and a drop or two of worcestershire and a drop of frank hot sauce . tuesday is dollar burger 5 until midnight , daily drink and happy hour selection , but even that is not enough to get me here . skip it . one caveat for this location , free parking . at station square is location you got ta pay to park the jalopy.i am eager to see if this place see a huge drop in business when burgatory open across the street .
i am normally a bar louie fan - my husband and i love the one in tampa . this location need a lot of work . we went on a friday evening before a show at the improv . we were looking to meet up with friend and have drink and a quick bite to eat . we never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received . we got there at about 6:40/6:45 so happy hour wa wrapping up , but i would say that the bar wa not even 3/4 full . there were also plenty of empty table . this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction . but we grabbed a table . i am not a clock watcher , so i am not sure how long it took u to get a server but it wa at least 5-7 minute . then we got our drink at 7:04 . the only reason that i know is because i wa looking at my phone because my husband and i wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of happy hour . that went out the window . when our friend for there ; they ordered drink . we finished them and left . the server wa nice , that is not the issue . the issue wa how grossly understaffed they were . they had two bartender on ( i think ) and not nearly enough cocktail server . the server apologized for the wait on the drink , but explained it away with `` this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped '' . that is a sign that you need more staff . i have never had this happen at any other bar before . get more staff . we ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time , not the fact that we did not get hh pricing . even though , in my opinion , they should have honored hh pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55 . we ended up going to the improv and got food there . bar louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our pittsburgh business again or our friend who live there .
we stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie . our server , wa friendly . my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me.both drink were overly sweet and barely any alcohol . after i finished my drink , i used my fork to dig for the blackberry at the bottom only to find ( to my disgust ) , a decent sized piece of clear saran wrap ! ugg ! did they muddle the mint into the saran wrap ? ! ! ! she comped the drink but we will not be back.ca not speak about the food since we did not have any but atmosphere wa loud and it wa difficult to have a conversation without repeating yourself .
i can not even review this place . we sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order , and we waited and waited until we got tired and just left . and i have to be clear it wa a saturday afternoon , maybe like 10 table with people at them and i saw 3 waitress walking around . i think it is probably a bad idea to ignore people that come into your restaurant , especially since burgatory just opened across the street .
man , hater gon na hate . listen , y'all , bar louie is not fancy . it is just not and their extensive martini list will not fool me . however , the food is good ole american bar grub and their beer selection is decent . the staff ha been nothing but nice even when my wannabe rowdy group of friend spent many a summer day sitting a table for four hour drinking dollar beer . a long a bar louie still keep having $ 1 burger day ( tuesday ) and $ 1 beer day ( wednesday ) , i will continue to be a fan . fyi , it is a fanatically cheap movie & dinner/drinks weekday date spot .
the food wa okay . the noise level -- with 10 people in a huge room -- deafening . awful acoustic !
food is shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly . staff is ok no complaint drink are good a well
eh , this place wa okay but it wa sort of a weird crowd/overall experience for a saturday night.bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar . tip : if you sit behind the tap , no one will bother to acknowledge you exist . when we moved seat , we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minute in our original seat . it wa not all that busy , either . most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were . it seems that bar louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list . maybe i am just salty about the wait .
i rather like bar louie for my outdoor dining experience after biking the rail trail or before a movie . been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasion and both time had their appetizer . note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknight , your pocket book will thank you.the two of u diner selected three appetizer to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation , quantity , and quality.i would highly recommend the bruschetta pomodoro and the calamari ( breaded just right and not overdone ) .
really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour . no one want to pay $ 8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality .
i do not frequent bar louie , and i really do not plan to change that any time soon . i have eaten here and stopped in for drink a couple time over the year and i just have not been super impressed by the place.the food ha been decent - a few year back i splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it , glutton that i am - but their meal and appetizer alike have admittedly never `` wowed '' me . and while i enjoy their cocktail and would consider stopping in just for drink more often , the problem is that thing are way overpriced here . even during the happy hour drink are pretty costly , not to mention that i think most of the drink i personally like do not qualify for the happy hour discount , which is disappointing . once i stopped in with friend after a movie and one drink cost me $ 10 here . not even a large one , either ! sorry , but i find that to be kind of ridiculous , especially since there is cheaper place to get drink in the area.still , the food and drink are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced , so this place would be rated 3 star in my mind if i could hear myself think when i eat here . but good lord , they are just so loud ! i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard . not cool , bar louie . not cool.so while the food and drink are fine enough the loud venue and price mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite place - and given the other option we have at the waterfront i do not expect to be back in any time soon .
my son a and i came for tuesday dollar burger night . you can gat a `` burger '' ( beef , chicken , portabella , or turkey ) in a bun with lettuce for a buck . then you can add topping to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cent , veggie 50 cent , artery cloggers 75 cent , sauce 25 cent . those are the heading and they have item listed under them-like 9 different cheese . you can also get a basket of tot or fry for a small price a well . my burger wa $ 2.25 after i added topping . is it the best burger i have ever had ? no . but is it the best $ 2.25 burger i have ever had ? yes . it is kind if a russian roulette a to how your burger will come to you cooked . mine wa well done and one if my son is burger had pink in the middle . we probably could have sent it back but we do not mind a little pink . i love the tater tot ! they are crispy and have the right amount of salt . yummy ! ! our server wa great and we will definitely be back .
great environment at night ! song going on very lively ! ! the food of my friend who ordered burger and fried shrimp wa not that great . but i ordered chicken flatbread which wa really delicious ! absolutely loved it will definitely go here again just for the flatbread
great atmosphere and rather humble , especially for a chain restaurant . the service is always friendly , even if they are busy . i enjoy taking client out for drink there because of the enjoyable bartender and wide array of drink on their menu . i highly recommend their chicken slider and you have to try their tempura shrimp . be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy too !
it is what i expected . cooler then a friday and the food wa about the same . it wa clean and out waiter wa really cool . it wa so slow he even took a seat with u and chatted but in a good way and we welcomed him to do so . i had the bar louie burger for my meal and it wa good . nothing outstanding but again what i expected . my group ordered the avocado fry and meatball appetizer . the avocado fry were good but we had to add salt . the meat ball with the small slice of garlic bread wa fun to share and yummy.we went on a slow sunday night . it wa clean and the food came out on time . again i rate a place on what i expect it to be and what it try is to be not what i think it should be . so just a different kind of friday . also great music playlist .
my boyfriend and i dined at bar louie at the waterfront about a month ago ; it wa my first time eating there and i wa pretty impressed ! we got loaded nacho a an appetizer and all the topping were a fresh a they come , not to mention delicious ! i ordered pasta ( i can not remember the name ) but i asked for no artichoke in it . it turned out the artichoke were pre-mixed in the recipe , but the waitress came and informed u that the chef wa whipping up a special batch just for me ! i wa extremely grateful and impressed.everything wa delicious , the decor wa industrial chic ( which i love ) and the atmosphere wa buzzing and fun . the menu wa a tad exotic for my small-town pallet , but it wa great . my only complaint wa the fact that you had to seat yourself , because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minute before we found a seat . the food and service certainly made up for it though !
best place for a late dinner . they have a pretty diverse and interesting menu . kitchen is open til 2am . the atmosphere is very relaxing and staff is always pleasant .
i went this evening . the chop chop salad wa awesome . the shrimp tempora wa too bready . the bartender were awful .
dollar beer on wednesday night and loaded tater tot , pretty much two solid reason to visit . matter of fact , they have some sort of special every night of the week wether it be food or drink or both ! located across from the movie theater this is a good place to go before or after a flick with your hot date . i say skip over priced burgatory and come here on tuesday for dollar burger . just a good and half the bill .
food wa 7 out of 10 for this type of bar / restaurant . service wa extremely poor and bar service wa also extremely poor . untrained and understaffed bartender will keep me from coming back . no reason to not be able to get a drink when sitting at the bar .
good drink ( new old fashioned ) food wa so so ( shrimp tempura app ) , but service wa not good and i think it may have been amateur night in the kitchen . food took a long time to arrive for a simple fried appetizer - approx . 20 min . with zero acknowledgment from my bartender . shrimp were cooked well , but sauce were extremely salty & sweet to be paired with tempura batter . the bar is drafty and customer other than me were complaining with no noticeable change . i am not staying for a main course
i wan na love bar louie , i do . it seems like even on the deadest of night it take 20 minute or more for a waitress to even show up at our table and get a drink order from u . the food is good , but the past 3 or 4 time i have come they have been out of tater tot by 9 pm , and i am always told after my order is put in and the kitchen decides it is now time to tell the wait staff they are out of something . it may be time to start frequenting a different location besides the one on the waterfront .
well it is 9pm on a tuesday and no tater tot . dip for the chip are cold and beer is room temperature . not very happy . will try the station square bar louie next time .
i absolutely love the ambiance of this place . the bar area is very large , and there is even some upstairs seating with nice couch and whatnot . a solid beer selection at reasonable price make you want to come back ! it doe not generally get very crowded ( even on friday and saturday night ) , so do not expect a south side type of environment . all that being said , there is a reason why this is a two-star review . even though this place doe not get crowded , it take a very long time to get served . i have waited up to 30 minute between round while sitting at a relatively empty bar .
i only go here when i can not get into burgatory and because i enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere . their really unhealthy food option like the loaded fry or loaded tot are pretty good , but their healthier food option are really lacking . i tried to get the blackened fish taco and the fish wa really dry and overcooked and of poor quality . the tortilla were completely stale and hard and had large gash down the middle . they have a decent beer selection but when i asked what their seasonal great lake on tap wa they said the christmas ale ( it is the last week in april now ) . i knew that if i ordered that draft it would be quite stale a it is probably been in there for 6 month now , so i got a southern tier instead which wa good . the service is ok but rather slow . overall i am pretty underwhelmed by this place .
my friend and i went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner . everywhere wa pretty busy so when we went into bar louie we were not upset it took at least ten minute for a server to come to our table . he immediately brought our water over and we ordered drink . only another 30 minute until he brought one martini over . we ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minute and our order wa messed up . we tried to be understanding when we learned it wa only our server first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out ! he did not get out of the weed for the 2 hour we were there . very disappointing and embarrassing on management part . we were not the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone wa upset . i hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolf on the second day .
sign stated `` seat yourself '' so we should have know the service would be horrible from the moment we walked in . we originally sat upstairs , which wa open per the sign . after 20 minute we got up and went outside . after 20 minute outside and after the waitress taking care of and making small talk with the table next to u , we said screw it and walked . the one other time that i had been there the service wa so-so . i will never go back . why should i have to try to track people down to pay for a meal ? ! ?
should have checked the review before we went . i have been to `` real '' bar louie is in other city . this is not one of them . wa seated for 20 min and no wait staff came to take our order . several of them made eye contact but did not feel the need to ask if we had been waited on . awkward . then someone came over with two plate of food trying to serve u . we thought , here wa our big chance to get served , but no , she just walked away . so we left . there are so many restaurant where you can get burger , just go someplace else .
wa there for saturday dinner at 6pm and still had some seat opened . we sat down right away . you sat yourself and menu wa at the table . very casual place , yet family place . a little noisy so not for date night . a little bit sport bar like but not like champ . food wa great . had boneless chicken nugget ( el fuego ) . side salad wa very good . i had verde chicken pasta and my husband had cod skewer with shrimp fried rice - i had some and it wa delicious . clean bathroom- very important .
i just walked into bar louie while we wait for our table at burgatory . we sat down at the bar and one bartender half acknowledged u and said he would `` be with u in a minute '' . we continued to sit there and wait . while she talked to other employee and walked around the bar to talk to the server . the only other bartender wa slowly walking around the other end of the bar . when she finally did make her way to our end she greeted the people who just sat down and ignored u who had been sitting there for 7 minute . this wa not a busy time and therefore ha no excuse for u having to wait more than 2 minute for a drink . we got up and walked out and will never be back . i have never had a good experience with bar louie no matter where it ha been . their customer service is always subpar . awful .
great place for late dinner after work . kitchen stay open late . real good food . full bar and real good service . great location .
came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a friday evening . they have some great happy hour deal - $ 3 draft ( with a nice selection ) and half off flat bread pizza . i believe there are three or four different type of the flat bread to choose from . my friend and i sat at the bar and i have to say the service wa just ok. we were not given plate or silverware with our pizza , the server did not seem to know what the other wa doing , and it wa a bit haphazard . i ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare i could have milked the cow . however , the tatertots served with it were delicious.located at the waterfront across from the movie theater bar louie offer both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you do not want to wait around at the other restaurant ( burgatory is directly across from it ! ) . this will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice .
i have had a pretty wide variety of experience at bar louie . sometimes i go and the service is decent and the drink are good , and sometimes i go and the service is really slow and the drink are flat or just plain bad . the one thing that is usually pretty consistent though is the food . any food that i have ordered ha always been pretty good . i have never had an amazing experience here , but i do still go back for food and drink special and because of it location near the movie theater .
i love bar louie is happy hour . $ 5 martini and half priced delicious veggie flatbread ? sign me up ! they also have a few other apps that are part of the happy hour , but the flatbread is the one i usually get . the melon martini is my current favorite , but most that i have tried have been good.i do not recommend the shrimp appetizer . and i am not sure about some of the other food , but happy hour is 5/5 star . the rest of the time , bar louie is probably a 3 star place . so , if you are in the waterfront and are thinking of bar louie , go for the happy hour !
worst bar i have ever been to . they used maybe no alchohol in their drink and consistency had no meaning here . we ordered three berry mojitos and they were different significantly . i posted a picture , you judge .
i went with some work friend before catching a movie later that night . we got to bar louie a little over 2 hour before the movie started , which left u with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done . we had a table right away and the server took drink order , but it took 15 minute to get our drink . she then disappeared for 30 minute before coming back to take a food order . the food took almost an hour , and we had only ordered a couple appetizer . the portion were really small for the price , and most of the food came out burnt . i did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food . again , waiting for the server to bring the check after the meal wa an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have . the place wa busy , but not overcrowded , what i would expect on a typical weeknight . there is no excuse for the poor service and food . on top of that , the restroom were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently . maybe it wa just an off night for this place , but i do not plan on going back again and taking that chance .
the worst bar and the worst service in the area . if i could give it 0 star i would . there is not one positive thing i could say about any time ive ever been here . it ha now been added to my very short list of place i will never step foot in again . please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .
my boyfriend and i came for $ 1 burger night and the food wa delicious ! i am not a huge bread fan ; i usually eat my sandwich open faced but i loved the bun . my boyfriend ordered a $ 1chicken and a $ 1burger and got both chicken . that would not be a big deal if the service made up for mistake . we love the atmosphere and taste of food but the service is horrible . this review is not based on a one night experience . out of three different time we have experienced bad service- very inattentive . manager need to review the importance of service with their staff . if some one like you and you are attentive to their need , they are le likely to complain ! bit when you are ignored and they make mistake , most make it a point to bring it to a manager attention !
the place where my fiancé and i first met . went back for anniversary , mentioned it to server , and were given a free dessert to help u celebrate . very , very cool bar louie ! love ya even more now ! jerk shrimp lettuce wrap are so spicy hot they blew u away - extremely spicy - very good but caused u to order plain old soft pretzel to balance out the heat . buffalo chicken flat bread - great but hot too
sat at the bar at about 240 saturday for appetizer and drink . not super busy but took over ten minute for a draft beer and martini . took 20 for appetizer . no offer to refill drink or for water . bartender wa organizing glass or drying glass ... passed u a couple time no eye contact despite empty glass pushed forward . others at the bar were also sitting with no drink , no order taken , and i stress it wa not full and the bartender wa not busy making drink . this is the second time this ha happened at this location during the day when it is not busy . we will stick with rock bottom if we are at waterfront during the day .
i enjoyed this place . i have avoided this location for so long . i gave it a shot tonight because of a work get together . our server name wa sarah and she wa great ! she wa attentive and on her game . i had the 'diva ' martini , which wa very sweet and fruity . the bruschetta wa good a well ( however not traditional ) , served with a mix of tomato , onion , lettuce . the soft pretzel stick were your typical pretzel stick , however good , and served with three dipping sauce , honey mustard , a cheese dip , and a brown sugar/butter dip . the chip and salsa were served with three salsa , guac , regular salsa with a kick , and the cheese dip . the bar is clean . the food is trustworthy and not half bad , it is noisy , but that is is to be expected . it is a great place to watch a game , hang with friend and let go of work . the location is prime a well . overall , a very pleasant surprise .
i made a reservation for 6 on a saturday night . when we arrived we were told by one of the waitress that they did not make reservation for le than six.then she changed that to six or le . i asked to speak with a manager who told me they do not make reservation for le than ten . they had no record of my reservation . the manager wa rude . she asked if i had called the right location . when i confirmed that i had , it wa apparent she did not believe me . when i told her i had made the reservation about 10 day earlier during a weekday afternoon and had spoken to a gentleman , she told me they only had one male manager and he said he did not make the reservation . i wa told she could try and find something for u , but there wa no way to tell how long that would take since it wa a saturday night . we did not stay to find out and have no interest in ever experiencing their brand of customer service again !
our adventure to the water front landed u here after our dinner at rock bottom ! we just came in here for a post dinner beer ! i can not really comment on anything except the quick bar service ! we went up to the bar and ordered our beer ! nothing to complicated ! it wa such a nice night out that we sat outside in front of the fire they had going ! the fire pit were located in each of the bar table ! i thought it wa pretty cool how they set that up ! we were not here very long ! would we visit this place again ? who know but it helped u kill sometime before we had to go to sing sing
the food wa ok. we ordered the pot pie soup but instead were given the tortilla . we did not mind too much but the soup wa way too spicy for me , and i usually like spicy food . i ordered the chicken sandwich and it wa decent . nothing to rave about . it wa just ordinary . my boyfriend ordered the chicken and bleu cheese flatbread , and i really liked it . i 'd suggest ordering that if you come here for a bite to eat . i also tried their pinot grigio , but it wa in a very dirty glass.service wa ok a well . it wa not really busy , but it wa steady . when we walked in no one wa around the door and there were dirty table everywhere . so we made our way towards the back and sat down at the only clean table . it seems like the waitress will not clean the table until after new customer sit down . after a few minute , i noticed a table of two that were beside u . they were there before u but they had yet to be taken care of even after we got our drink and ordered . all in all , this place just need a bit of organization .
valentine is day ! terrible service . waitress wa not attentive at all which would be understandable if it were extremely busy but it wa just steady . food is overpriced for portion . small fly flying around restaurant . i investigated myself to see where from and found fly egg hatching from dirty toilet paper on the floor in the men is room near the corner by the plunger . mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left . i will never visit again .
i go here often because i work down in the waterfront , the staff is very friendly and nice . the drink are very expensive but that is every bar louie . the one in homestead take forever for food , the wait is ridiculous . i spent almost 45 minute for some nacho . it is cool for a pre game and they have dollar burger on tuesday , and dollar brew on wednesday . it is very close to the movie theater so good for a date night ! but just make sure you give yourself a little time because the service is a bit bad .
surprisingly good fried chicken sandwich ( with decent tater tot ) and great happy hour beverage price on a wednesday night including $ 3.25 draft , some domestic were $ 1 . considering it wa a 70+ degree day in march , they were slammed and severely understaffed . no one wa bussing table except the waitress , and they were not very attentive to table , which led to some angry customer around us.still a worthwhile happy hour to check out :
a nice little quiet restaurant to come in for lunch . i am a little biased since in college my friend and i would come here for dollar burger night every tuesday and that wa the highlight of my shitty week . but i still recommend this place , always a fun time .
this is a bar louie and it is in one of the most touristy/family-friendly part of town , so it is not ever going to be an extremely highly rated experience for me personally . i went here with my boyfriend for a friend is birthday a few week back however , and i can say that this location ( a opposed to the nasty one in station square ) is pretty okay . the restaurant is spacious inside with plenty of potential to expand outdoors during the warmer month . we had excellent table service from a very nice server who did a good job keeping everyone is drink full . it wa dollar beer night , but all of the option on special were unfortunately not palatable if you like good beer . i would be much more inclined to come back for a beer night if bl rotated one ( just one ! ) nice craft option in with the others . plenty of people will still choose the piss of course , but one like me would be so happy . the free chip and dip appetizer i ordered wa great at least , particularly the guacamole . if i ever wa in the area i would come back and get that again and possibly a drinkable beer during happy hour , since those price looked good .
one dolla holla ! such excitement yet such epic failure when the tuesday $ 1 custom burger showed up naked a all get-out . one can not really complain for a $ 1 . but , when betty barkeep remediated the situ and fetched all of the topping initially ordered , the burger and portabella were worth the wait . and gim me some more o ' dem tot yo ! straight up addictive with salt + pepper and a hint o ' lime . bar louis is showing it age , but it ha been an anchor at the ever-changing waterfront .
i have been to bar louie several time and i do not have much to say about the food other than is it average and pretty boring bar food . the one thing different is the option for tater tot which people seem to enjoy . service is fine and price average . my most favorite thing from bar louie is without a doubt , the berry mojito ! i want one now they are so good ! made with fresh berry and mint ! i must get one every time ! you will not be disappointed if you like mojitos ! i think they are $ 10 which some might think is expensive but they are just so good ! good wise , i still have not had anything i really like and i 'd rather just come here for drink .
bar louie is my go to place in the waterfront . consistently good food and friendly talkative wait and bar staff . lot of wonderful special but nothing top tuesday , dollar burger night , a bar louie tradition . especially nice in the summertime when the garage door come up , window open and upper loft patio is full . flame pit are on the patio and provide warmth on a cool night.the food is an eclectic mix . burger are great a are the tot , get them loaded or better yet down them for speed : ) . mussel are good , salad are great ! appetizer are all excellent . try the bavarian pretzel with quest or the calamari ! my favorite , especially on a cold or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup . if you give a green light to the cook , he will spice it up to en fuego , the way it is meant to be eaten . endless refill of soft drink allow you to sit and chat for a long a you like . this is a wonderful spot to people watch on movie night or catch some of the steelers who like to stop by.love place that keep eating out fun . this is a place where they remember your name ! recommend strongly ! !
what a delightful experience for this chain establishment . we were in search of a place to dine outside on this perfect summer friday evening . the sign said seat yourself and on 1st pas the only table available were hightops built more fir standing with your adult beverage . this wa not on this gal preferred list . we attempted the joint next door but waiting 90 min wa an even i do not think so ... . back at bar louie we went and scored a recently vacated table . maria our awesome waitress greeted u kindly but have u some bad news ... they were training new kitchen staff and it wa taking a bit longer than usual for order to come out.. but she assured u once they did they were a yummy and up to bar louie standard people have come to expect . okay ... kudos , for letting u know in advance . we ordered drink and the food came out quicker than expected . i ordered the chop chop salad and added shrimp to mine ... wa done perfectly and the slice of garlic toast wa a welcome addition . my husband opted for the savory mac n cheese pork sandwich ... .my taste bite wa scrumptious and lived up to maria is hype . great food ... superb service ... great to see a chat in restaurant can still offer patron something to come back for !
literally the only place to stop in waterfront . best happy hour ! ! martini and draft half off ? our server kayla wa phenomenal .
food wa good . waitress wa kayla and she wa excellent . it wa busy but she handled it and gave our table undivided attention . thanks kayla .
insanely sticky floor , frozen food that is reheated in a microwave and $ 10 drink that taste like sugar water . skip this place if you do not want to feel ill after dining .
i am not into waterparks a much a i am into amusement park . i go to sandcastle maybe once a year . but my chicago friend catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo , we donned our swimsuit and came here . the main part of the park is closed in the evening , but the sandbar and the sandbar pool and the hot tub remain open for the 21 and over set . the sandbar ha a great menu of food and drink and ha a $ 6.00 cover charge to get in . occasionally there is live entertainment.it is hard to believe that before they built this place , it wa the site of an abandoned steel mill . actually , it wa the railroad yard for the nearby homestead work . but after site-clearing and clean-up , they turned it into a beautiful place to spend a warm day or nice evening . the view across the mon is quite beautiful with a wooded hillside on the other side . there is even a boat dock , so you can arrive by river if you desire.i am glad i renewed my acquaintance with this place and hopefully , i will get another chance to come back .
the evites are in the mail for the 2 for $ 99 special ! you will have to spend $ 24 on a parking pas . i signed up last year for this promotion and do not think i got the pass worth . the waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day . there are just too many miss in my book though.1st off all traffic is a biatch ! be ready to sit on brown hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am . next remember it is a family park so there will be lot of rude and bratty kid all over the place . ( i am not a mean kid hater ) my experience have been bad at the sandbar pool . if you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kid that will push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chair with towel even though they will not use them because they run around the park all day . i actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid . i wa like `` i am an adult and you need to have some respect . '' he pushed me and took all the chair . i only needed one and his mother did not correct him . i wa on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still wa giving me crap because i moved the chair over ... that no one wa even there to sit in at the time . damn ! for real ! sandbar drink are expensive and incredibly weak . plus they are so sugary . if you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minute . an adult area would change all this . i do not even care that i am getting splashed all the time i do realize that i am at a pool but it is hard to relax.if you do get a pas have a friend who can get there the same day you can go . if you are trying to go on the weekend forget it ! the weekday are bad enough . i am looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .
it is fun , but not a fun a kennywood . the boardwalk food is a bit too far from the wave pool and that make for a lot of shoe on/shoes off event . the lazy river could be much better . i did like the water slide and the potato patch fry , a well a the scenic location .
how many time do you get to fall at 70mph , wearing only short ? sandcastle can make it happen.if you are going , it is best to stop by giant eagle and grab you some discount ticket from the customer service desk . $ 25 is still a bit much in my opinion , but it is better than spending the full $ 30.99.there is not much i can think of that is in sandcastle that is not a great time , except maybe walking around and scorching your foot on the boardwalk . i personally am a huge fan of some of the faster tube slide , and of course the massive speed slide . if you are looking for a more relaxed ride , check out the lazy river , or screw around in the big pool . there is also a pretty nice wave pool there for your amusement.there is also plenty of stuff for kid to do ... but i do not have kid , so i do not know how all that is.they do close at 7pm , which is a bit early , so be warned : you definitely want to show up earlier in the day . but it is definitely a good idea to close the park if you can : right toward the end , the line disappear , and you can ride over and over . win !
sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos . on the one hand , there are plenty of waterslides/pools that are a good fit for young `` rider '' , on the other hand , sandcastle , like any city amusement park , attracts more than it fair share of highschool kid looking to spend some time away from their parent and assert their personhood . unfortunately that element doe not particularly care about `` censoring '' speech for 9 year old ear , and worse , in the mon tsunami , about personal space , since the wave pool becomes a near mosh pit of jostling and strutting and shoving and 'showing off ' for the fairer sex , and that can be a little dicey for the littler kids.having said that , it is still a good day at the park . . . cheese fry , a cool dip in the pool on a hot day , some fun slide . . . i think in rating sandcastle fairly you have to understand the context of the park . it is not policed particularly effectively . if you take small child you have to be a diligent parent and be aware of your surroundings , paying attention to the group of 17 somethings thrashing around in your near vicinity , `` accidentally '' bumping into people for a reaction from their group . mostly it is a good time . mostly .
so the last time i went to a water park wa probably when i wa in elementary school and did not really know how to swim ( ... i still kinda do not . lol ) . anyway , it wa in california at raging river and it wa a traumatizing experience . screaming & being tossed around in the pool that push periodic wave at the sound of a loud horn and ending up with scraped knee and foot . not fun.so to say the least , i wa a bit nervous coming to this water park afraid to have another episode of feeling i wa being drowned . luckily that did not happen.i seriously had so much fun here ! i honestly wa only expecting to go on the lazy river pool all day but with my bf , we hit up so many ride ... tandem and single ride ! i feel like such a big girl now ! definitely lean back while you are on those single donut on the water ride , or else you feel like you are going to flip over while swishing down the tube . the new dragon ride they just opened up wa okay . i wa expecting it to be so much more fun , but literally you just slide down a dark tube into a circular room where you just slowly swirl your way down the middle hole and that wa it . there wa this one ride where you slide down the tube for a few second , then you land into a pool where a worker push you into another tube and this continues about 3 time . it wa weird . kinda awkward with the worker having to grab you and push you through . although it wa still fun . the last dude threw me in backwards ! scared the crap out of me but it wa fun : ) the food here is surprisingly pretty affordable . plus , who want to eat a huge meal while in your swim suit . me do not want no pot belly . overall i had such a fun time here . it definitely made me rethink my fear of water park . by the way , we went on a saturday in early june and it wa not a packed a i thought it would be ! so the line were not long at all . also , go to giant eagle to purchase your discounted ticket . you save a few buck versus buying them at the water park . oh and do not forget to bring sandal while walking around . your foot will literally feel like they are burning from the ground . now go off and have some fun ! : )
